Dustin and Melissa, with the help of a \xe2\x80\x9cFat Face\xe2\x80\x9d app, distorted Alex\xe2\x80\x99s features, while also making offensive comments about the girl. </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/uk/196116-charity-lobby-twitter-register/" target="_blank">READ MORE: Lobbying laws: Charities ordered to monitor employee\xe2\x80\x99s social media</a> </p><p> According to the court document, <em>\xe2\x80\x9cAfter Dustin created the account, both Dustin and Melissa added information to the unauthorized profile, which indicated inter alia, racist viewpoints and a homosexual orientation. Dustin and Melissa also caused the persona to issue invitations to become \xe2\x80\x98Friends\xe2\x80\x99 to many of Alex\xe2\x80\x99s classmates, teachers, and extended family members,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> wrote the Georgia Court of Appeals in its opinion. <br><br> The court described the content on the false Facebook page as <em>\xe2\x80\x9cgraphically sexual, racist or otherwise offensive."</em> <br><br> Upon discovering the Facebook page set up in their daughter\xe2\x80\x99s name, Alex\xe2\x80\x99s parents, Amy and Christopher Boston, met with the school\xe2\x80\x99s principal to discuss the matter. Dustin and Melissa confessed to their actions and signed a statement to that effect, as well as receiving a two-day suspension from school. <br><br> Although the parents of the students were notified in writing as to their children\xe2\x80\x99s actions, the fake Facebook page, purporting to be Alex Boston, remained visible for another 11 months until Facebook finally deactivated the account. In that period of time, <em>\xe2\x80\x9cthe fake persona continued to extend or accept requests to become Facebook friends with additional users and that other users viewed and posted on the unauthorized page\xe2\x80\xa6,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> according to the court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. <br><br> Presiding Judge John J. Ellington ruled that the parents may be found legally liable for not having their son remove the fake Facebook profile that made potentially libelous statements against the classmate. <br><br><em>\xe2\x80\x9cGiven that the false and offensive statements remained on display, and continued to reach readers, for an additional 11 months, we conclude that a jury could find that the [parents\'] negligence proximately caused some part of the injury [the girl] sustained from [the boy\'s] actions (and inactions),\xe2\x80\x9d</em> wrote Judge Ellington in the opinion. <br><br> Natalie Woodward, the attorney who represented Alex Boston, said she believed the appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s decision could set a new precedent. <br><br> The ruling indicates that in <em>\xe2\x80\x9ccertain circumstances, when what is being said about a child is untrue and once the parents know about it, then liability is triggered,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> she told Law Blog. <br><br> The case now heads back to the lower court for trial. <br><br> Last year, two Florida girls were accused of cyberbullying Rebecca Sedwick, a 12-year-old classmate, who eventually committed suicide by jumping to her death from a concrete factory. <br><br> Sedwick\xe2\x80\x99s mother said that over a dozen girls had continued to harass her daughter over the internet, even after the girl had changed schools, the Daily News reported. <br><br> However, charges of aggravated stalking against Katelyn Roman, 13, and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, were eventually dropped. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/196424-vatican-homosexuals-catholic-opposition/</guid><title><![CDATA[Ultra-conservative Catholics hit out at possible Vatican plans to welcome gays]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/196424-vatican-homosexuals-catholic-opposition/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/f4/80/00/vatican-homosexuals-catholic-opposition.jpg" title="Reuters / Tony Gentile "/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 10:25:03 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/f4/80/00/vatican-homosexuals-catholic-opposition.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Catholic conservatives have reacted furiously to a Vatican document that advocates a possible shift towards more tolerance to homosexuals.

They said that a final version of the document would be issued, following a meeting of around 200 bishops, which will conclude on Sunday. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Synod groups work to fine tune document on family life \xc2\xa7RV <a href="http://t.co/3Q3uuzpQiD">http://t.co/3Q3uuzpQiD</a> </p> <p> \xe2\x80\x94 Vatican - news (@news_va_en) <a href="https://twitter.com/news_va_en/status/522410345810640896">October 15, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> However, conservatives within the Catholic Church have accused liberals of trying to <em>\xe2\x80\x9crailroad the assembly\xe2\x80\x9d</em> and that their views do not reflect the general consensus within the Vatican. </p><p> One of its fiercest critics was Cardinal Raymond Burke from the United States. The ultra-conservative stated, <em>"While the document purports to report only the discussion which took place among the synod fathers, it, in fact, advances positions which many synod fathers do not accept,"</em> he told the Catholic World. </p><p> He added that <em>"A great number of the synod fathers found it objectionable,"</em> and said he would ask Pope Francis to deliver a defining statement, which would defend traditional family values and reject further integration of homosexuals into the Church\xe2\x80\x99s sphere. </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/news/195572-pope-catholic-synod-gays/" target="_blank">On Monday</a>, Cardinal Peter Erdo of Hungary delivered an interim report, which stated that homosexuals had <em>\xe2\x80\x9cgifts and qualities to offer\xe2\x80\x9d</em> while he even went as far as saying that the Catholic Church would eventually recognize same-sex relationships. </p><p> </p><p> Echoing Cardinal Burke\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, Cardinal Wilfrid Fox Napier of South Africa stated that, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not a true message.\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p> <em>"The message has gone out that this is what the synod is saying, that this is what the Catholic Church is saying ... Whatever we say hereafter will seem like we\'re doing damage control,"</em> Napier added, which was reported by Reuters. </p><p> Since <a href="http://rt.com/news/time-pope-francis-person-2013-058/" target="_blank">Pope Francis</a> replaced his predecessor, Pope Benedict, he has looked to be far more compassionate towards homosexuals. In a speech last year, he stated, <em>"If a person is gay and seeks God and has goodwill, who am I to judge?"</em> However, the document, which was released on Monday, shows that the Church still condemns homosexual acts; however, it recognizes that gays could play a role within the Church. </p><p> The text added that <em>"Homosexuals have gifts and qualities to offer the Christian community: are we capable of welcoming these people, guaranteeing to them a further space in our communities? Often they wish to encounter a Church that offers them a welcoming home,"</em> said the document, which is known by its Latin name \xe2\x80\x98relatio\xe2\x80\x99. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Vatican considers \xe2\x80\x98welcoming gifts and qualities of gays\xe2\x80\x99 <a href="http://t.co/9U3fqph52Y">http://t.co/9U3fqph52Y</a><a href="http://t.co/x5HjCXeMCh">pic.twitter.com/x5HjCXeMCh</a> </p> <p> \xe2\x80\x94 RT (@RT_com) <a href="https://twitter.com/RT_com/status/521689169048121345">October 13, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> <em>"Are our communities capable of proving that, accepting and valuing their sexual orientation, without compromising Catholic doctrine on the family and matrimony?"</em> it added. </p><p> Francis DeBernardo, executive director of the US lesbian and gay pressure group, New Ways Ministry, said he was pleased at the Vatican\xe2\x80\x99s tentative shift saying, <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just a change of tone. Never before as the church talked about lesbians and gays having \xe2\x80\x98gifts\xe2\x80\x99 to offer. Never before has the church accepted that their sexual orientation has something positive to offer.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> He added, <em>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is also significant and hopeful is what is not said\xe2\x80\xa6 there is no vicious condemnation of them, as in previous hierarchical statements. We don\xe2\x80\x99t see the gloom and doom and apocalyptic horror that Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI and their followers have foretold because of the advent of same-gender marriages,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> as reported by the Independent. </p><p> </p><p> Vatican expert John Thavis who wrote the book \xe2\x80\x98The Vatican Diaries,\xe2\x80\x99 stated that the text was, <em>\xe2\x80\x9can earthquake\xe2\x80\x9d</em> in the Church\xe2\x80\x99s attitude to gays. </p><p> <em>"The document clearly reflects Pope Francis\' desire to adopt a more merciful pastoral approach on marriage and family issues,"</em> he said. </p><p> The text also potentially opens doors for other groups who had been sidelined by the Catholic Church\xe2\x80\x99s rigid policies. Heterosexual couples who were married in civil services or living together could become further integrated. The Vatican is not openly supportive of untraditional unions; they have mentioned the <em>\xe2\x80\x9cpositive aspects\xe2\x80\x9d</em> of these unions.

What impact will that have on the eurozone?</em></span> </p><p> <strong>Fabio de Masi:</strong> It will certainly have a very large impact because Germany is one of the largest economies in the eurozone and we have also stagnation in France, Italy slips into its third recession. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a big problem for the eurozone. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What is the root causes of Germany\'s growth slumping?</em> </p><p> <strong>FM:</strong> I never believed the story of the German economic powerhouse or German economic miracle. Last year we had a growth rate of only 0.4 percent. The former government would have been embarrassed by a figure like that, and they said this is the German economic miracle. We certainly see the effects of austerity in other European countries; we are not living on an island. So if you cut wages, pensions, public investment, the German economy will also be affected. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have a party in the garden when the house of your neighbor is burning. Secondly, we have cooling down in the US, monetary policies becoming tighter, we have cooling down of the Chinese economy. Thirdly, we have sanctions against Russia which also negatively affect the German economy. And the only one who is benefiting from these sanctions is the US. </p><p> <strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href="http://rt.com/business/195896-german-economy-forecast-cut/" target="_blank">German economy in \xe2\x80\x98choppy waters\xe2\x80\x99, as growth forecast slashed to 1.2%</a> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>France has recently lashed out at Germany and its austerity regime. Does France have a point, or is it just jealous that Germany is still standing on its two feet?</em> </p><p> <strong>FM:</strong> There is no reason to be jealous about Germany because we have huge sector of precarious work, roughly 20-25 percent of our workforce is not earning enough to maintain themselves. Secondly, they have clearly a point because when you have private households over indebted and they have to deleverage, so they have to cut back on consumption, business will not invest and the state is doing the same. There are only these three sectors of the economy, and then there is no way out of economic depression. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong><em>Why is austerity not working in mainland Europe, but for the UK it seems to be having the desired affect?</em> </p><p> <strong>FM:</strong> The UK is a completely different point because the UK has strong economic ties with the US. The US didn\xe2\x80\x99t impose such harsh austerity measures; they had more expensive fiscal policy. Plus, the UK has some leverage because they have pretty much a flexible exchange rate \xe2\x80\x93 that is what the eurozone does not have. Opposed to that, the eurozone tried to make what the economists are calling <em>\xe2\x80\x9cinternal devaluation,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> so cutting back on wages, pensions, public investment, hitting the majority of the population, and this can clearly not work. If private households have to cut back on consumption and the state does the same, then private business will never invest and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to crowd in private investment to kick-start economy, by more public investment. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Do you expect Germany to leave the eurozone?</em> </p><p> <strong>FM:</strong> No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Germany will leave the eurozone because the government has no interest in doing so as the other eurozone members are the main export destinations. However, I believe firmly that no democracy can survive that, for example, in Greece every second young person is without employment. If they continue down that road, we already saw the results during the European elections when right-wing parties came first in the elections in the UK, in France with Front National, if they continue this way then it will have big political repercussions, and other countries might feel forced to leave. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/politics/196412-russia-ukraine-economic-regime/</guid><title><![CDATA[Nationalist lawmakers ask PM to put economic pressure on Ukraine]]></title><link>http://rt.com/politics/196412-russia-ukraine-economic-regime/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/f3/c0/00/02471126.jpg" title="RIA Novosti / Andrey Iglov"/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 09:49:02 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/f3/c0/00/02471126.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />A Liberal Democratic party lawmaker is urging Russia\xe2\x80\x99s government to ban all supplies of foodstuffs, machinery and metal products from Ukraine in a bid to force Kiev into observing the Minsk ceasefire agreements.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/f3/c0/00/02471126.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="RIA Novosti / Andrey Iglov" /> <p> In his letter to Prime Minister Dmitry Medevedev, MP Roman Khudyakov wrote that a tough economic policy would help to end the armed standoff in Ukraine quickly. </p><p> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Russia must react to Kiev\xe2\x80\x99s unscrupulous behavior. But due to the fact that we cannot react by military force, we must act through economic means.

We should stop the outrageous things like repressions against dissidents, terror against their own people and military aggression against the Donetsk and Lugansk republics</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d the lawmaker added. </p><p> He said that if the Ukrainian military continues to shell the territories of the two breakaway republics, Russia should stop all supplies of natural gas. </p><p> The MP also wants to compile a list of Ukrainian business people who would face an entry ban and asset freeze in Russia. He did not mention any particular names in the interview with Izvestia. In September, Russian law enforcers arrested the assets of Ukrainian oligarch Igor Kolomoyskiy, after he was charged in absentia with sponsoring terrorism and war crimes. </p><p> Khudyakov also stressed in the letter that the new harsh policy against the Ukrainian authorities must not touch upon ordinary citizens. In particular, the new measures should not target aircraft and railway transport and also money transfers that Ukrainian workers send home from Russia. </p><p> Earlier Khudyakov addressed the Russian Prosecutor General with a suggestion to launch a probe into contracts between Russian state and municipal enterprises and Ukrainian companies, such as the deal between the St Petersburg Metro and a Ukrainian car-building plant. </p><p> The suggestion has already received support from the deputy chair of the Lower House Committee for Defense, MP Sergey Zhigarev (LDPR), but he noted in comments that all steps must be executed with the utmost caution. </p><p> Moscow earlier introduced trade sanctions against the US, EU and some other countries that had applied economic pressure on Russia over the situation in Ukraine, and also blacklisted a number of EU officials who had maintained an especially strong anti-Russian stance. The Russian Foreign Ministry has said that the names on the blacklist will not be disclosed. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/196404-russia-africans-hospital-ebola/</guid><title><![CDATA[Ebola ready: Two students hospitalized in precautionary medical drills]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/196404-russia-africans-hospital-ebola/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/f3/40/00/rtr4934u.jpg" title="Reuters / Christopher Black"/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 08:28:30 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/f3/40/00/rtr4934u.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Two African students were taken to hospital in the Russian town of Oryol, some 350 km southwest of Moscow.

(AFP Photo / Thomas Samson)" /> <p> Elo\xc3\xafse Bouton, 31, then a Femen member, was topless when she got inside the Catholic Madeleine Church in Paris a few days before Christmas 2013. She simulated an abortion by carrying to the altar pieces of a calf\xe2\x80\x99s liver, symbolically representing the fetus. The act culminated in Bouton urinating on the altar\xe2\x80\x99s steps. <br><br> Bouton, who quit Femen after the incident, citing \xe2\x80\x9c<em>personal reasons</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d appeared in a court in Paris to face trial for "<em>indecent exposure</em>," on Wednesday. <br><br> The prosecutor requested three to four months of suspended sentence and a 1,500-euro fine (around $1,920). </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SmjGxb_NSqo" allowfullscreen="" height="360" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe> </p><p> Bouton\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer insists that what his defendant did was a political protest and not an act of public exhibition, and asked for the international law on freedom of expression to be applied in her case. <br><br> The verdict in Bouton\xe2\x80\x99s case won\xe2\x80\x99t be announced until mid-December. Meanwhile, the French justice system has already proven mild to Femen activists. <br><br> Last month, France\xe2\x80\x99s court cleared the activists, who staged a topless protest in the iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris in February 2013. The female group then marked Pope Benedict XVI\'s resignation by shouting slogans like \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Bye-bye Benedict!</em>\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c<em>No more homophobe!</em>\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p> </p><p> The only convictions in the case were eventually the fines imposed not on the topless protesters in the landmark Paris cathedral, but on the security staff of Notre Dame, who pulled the women away from the church. The fines of up to 1,000 euro (about $ 1,264) were suspended. </p><p> However, French justice has been tougher on offenders in a mosque. <br><br> A group which placed a pig\xe2\x80\x99s head outside a mosque in the French overseas territory of Mayotte in January saw its members convicted of \xe2\x80\x9c<em>incitement to hatred, violence or discrimination because of religious affiliation</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d They were given prison sentences. <br><br> The act was carried out by Sarah Leduc, 36, and Malika Lenormand, 44 with the help of Leduc\xe2\x80\x99s partner Constable S\xc3\xa9bastien Milin, 34. The three claimed it was a result of a bet made while they were drunk at a New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve party. <br><br> The act caused outrage among Mayotte\xe2\x80\x99s population, 95 percent of whom are Muslim. </p><p> </p><p> Leduc and Lenormand were sentenced to nine months, six months of which were suspended, while Milin received a six-month suspended prison sentence. <br><br> They also got two years\xe2\x80\x99 probation work, were fined 3,000 euro ($3,796) each and were forced to pay 16,000 euro ($20,249) in compensation to the mosque. <br><br> According to Julien Pinelli, the lawyer defending the trio, the fact that the population in the area is almost entirely Muslim influenced the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision. <br><br> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>It was a special case because it took place in Mayotte, where 95 percent of the population are Muslims, so I think this aspect of the case had an influence on the decision that has been made</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d he told RT. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_9QxvBKLsvw" allowfullscreen="" height="360" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe> </p><p> Pinelli launched a formal appeal based on the fact that blasphemy and sacrilege are not criminal offences in France. However, he believes the country should protect all its holy places and the French penal code needs to reflect this. <br><br> The difference in verdicts for similar acts in churches and mosques is explained by political reasons, believes Frederic Pichon, president of the association of free lawyers. <br><br> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Femen have judiciary protection for ideological reasons</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d Pichon told RT. \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Fifty years ago there were only four mosques in France for 1 million Muslims. Now we have 8 million Muslims and almost 3,000 mosques</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d <br><br> He added that France has \xe2\x80\x9c<em>double standards</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d <br><br> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>If you attack Christianity, it\'s free expression.

The comedian, who has starred in a number of popular Russian romcoms, began his standup routine on the local TV program <em>\xe2\x80\x98Vecherniy Kiev\xe2\x80\x99</em> with the words <em>\xe2\x80\x9cGlory to Ukraine\xe2\x80\x9d</em> \xe2\x80\x93 a nationalist greeting now often used as a show of patriotism. <br><br> The premise of the comedian\xe2\x80\x99s set was reading out a letter addressed to his relatives in Russia, which ridiculed what Ukrainians claim are mass media-imposed stereotypes. <br><br> The comic began with jokes about <em>\xe2\x80\x98Banderas\xe2\x80\x99</em>, referring to Stepan Bandera\xe2\x80\x99s nationalist movement, which collaborated with Nazi Germany at the start of World War II and was involved in the ethnic cleansing of Poles, Jews and Russians. Ukrainian nationalists are often called Banderas by their opponents. <br><br> Zelensky joked that <em>\xe2\x80\x9cthings will be even better now\xe2\x80\x9d</em> since he joined the ranks of Banderas with many others, as there is <em>\xe2\x80\x9cno other way to make a career in Ukraine.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> <br><br><em>\xe2\x80\x9cI have a small salary, but it is not important, as we are now allowed to take away money and property from the Russians. Before we could do the same to the Jews,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> he sarcastically said. <br><br> At one point of the sketch, the comedian also asked his relatives to send out a copy of Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s Mein Kampf (incidentally banned in Russia), adding that all the copies of the book <em>\xe2\x80\x9chave sold out\xe2\x80\x9d</em> in Ukraine. He even imitated a Nazi salute as part of the show. </p><p> </p><p> The letter also invited them to come and visit Ukraine, but with a warning not to use planes. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is dangerous!\xe2\x80\x9d</em> he joked, seamlessly forgetting that 298 people were killed as MH17 went down over Ukraine. The joke was followed by the audience laughter. <br><br> He added that the safest way to travel is by means of white Kamaz trucks, which have a <em>\xe2\x80\x9cregular schedule and no delays\xe2\x80\x9d</em> \xe2\x80\x93 referring to vehicles used for transporting Russian humanitarian aid to eastern Ukraine. <br><br> Zelensky then poked fun at the US role in the Ukrainian conflict. <br><br><em>\xe2\x80\x9cNow, for example, I am learning English to forget Russian. American mercenaries are helping me out. They are here on every corner. Why am I telling you this? You already know everything,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> he jested. <br><br> The US theme was taken even further: <em>\xe2\x80\x9cToday our president \xe2\x80\x93 the most, most important one \xe2\x80\x93 Barack Obama promised that we will soon become part of NATO, of course with the rights of an American henchman.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> <br><br> To ridicule the gravity of the Ukrainian crisis the comic said he is going <em>\xe2\x80\x9cto dig out a bunker.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> <br><br> The comedian has been in trouble before, forced to apologize for offending the Muslim population in a previous routine that made fun of the leader of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov. <br><br> Meanwhile, on the ground in eastern Ukraine a shaky truce has been established between self-defense forces and the Kiev government, with occasional shelling still occurring. <br><br> The latest report from the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine from Tuesday described seven people being killed and 15 other injured in heavy shelling by a \xe2\x80\x98Grad\xe2\x80\x99 multiple rocket-launcher system, northeast of Mariupol. Shelling was also reported northeast of Donetsk. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/196364-fukushima-radiation-record-typhoon/</guid><title><![CDATA[Radiation levels at Fukushima rise to record highs after typhoon]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/196364-fukushima-radiation-record-typhoon/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/f0/c0/00/fukushima-radiation-record-typhoon.jpg" title="A Tokyo Electric Power Co.

Cesium, which is highly soluble and can spread easily, is known to be capable of causing cancer. <br><br> Meanwhile, other measurements also show remarkably high levels of tritium \xe2\x80\x93 another radioactive isotope of hydrogen. Samples from October 9 indicate that there are 150,000 becquerels of tritium per liter in the groundwater near Fukushima, according to Japan\xe2\x80\x99s JIJI agency. Compared to levels recorded last week, that\xe2\x80\x99s an increase of more than 10 times. <br><br> Additionally, <em>\xe2\x80\x9cmaterials that emit beta rays, such as strontium-90, which causes bone cancer, also shattered records with a reading of 1.2 million becquerels, the utility said of the sample,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> JIJI reported. </p><p> </p><p> <br><br> Officials blamed these increases on the recent typhoon, which resulted in large amounts of rainfall and injured dozens of people on Okinawa and Kyushu before moving westward towards Tokyo and Fukushima. <br><br> While cesium is considered to be more dangerous than tritium, both are radioactive substances that authorities would like to keep from being discharged into the Pacific Ocean in high quantities. <br><br> For now, extra measures to contain the issue are not on the table, since <em>\xe2\x80\x9cadditional measures have been ruled out since the depth and scope of the contaminated water leaks are unknown, and TEPCO already has in place several measures to control the problem, such as the pumping of groundwater or walls to retain underground water,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> according to the IANS news service. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/196356-pazyryk-princess-breast-cancer/</guid><title><![CDATA[MRI reveals ancient Siberian \xe2\x80\x98princess\xe2\x80\x99 had breast cancer]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/196356-pazyryk-princess-breast-cancer/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/f0/40/00/he-pazyryk-mommy-died-from-a-21st-century-disease_-and-used-a-popular-herb-to-cope.jpg" title="Mummy of Princess Ukok  in Anokhin museum in the Republic of Altai (RIA Novosti / Alexandr Kryazhev)"/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 04:52:58 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/f0/40/00/he-pazyryk-mommy-died-from-a-21st-century-disease_-and-used-a-popular-herb-to-cope.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Brand new MRI scans have revealed that a 2,500-year-old ancient Pazyryk \'princess\' died from the same disease that over a million women are fighting today: breast cancer.

She has been linked to the nomadic Pazyryk culture that inhabited the plateau about 5th Century BC. <br><br> Scientists knew she was young since she died at the age of 25, but only recently did they discover what probably caused her death. <br><br> Using MRI scanners, scientists detected asymmetrical signals in the mummy. <br><br> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>During the imaging of mammary glands, we paid attention to their asymmetric structure and the varying asymmetry of the MRI signal. We are dealing with a primary tumor in the right breast and right axial lymph nodes with metastases</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Andrey Letyagin of the Institute of Physiology and Fundamental Medicine told The Siberian Times. <br><br> Letyagin worked with Dr. Andrey Savelov of the International Tomography Center, and together their findings were recently published in Science First Hand journal. <br><br> The mysterious woman in question was a little over 20 years old when she developed breast cancer, which destroyed her over five years later, Letyagin told the journal. <br><br> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>The three first thoracic vertebrae showed a statistically significant decrease in MR signal and distortion of the contours, which may indicate the metastatic cancer process</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9c<em>I am quite sure of the diagnosis - she had cancer. She was extremely emaciated. Given her rather high rank in society and the information scientists obtained studying mummies of elite Pazyryks, I do not have any other explanation of her state. Only cancer could have such an impact</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d <br><br> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>It is clearly seen the tumor in her right breast, visible is the metastatic lesion of the lymph node and spine\xe2\x80\xa6She had cancer and it was killing her</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d said Letyagin. </p><p> </p><p> Still, Letyagin said it is hard to know if cancer was the direct cause of her death because he could also see traces of trauma in her bones \xe2\x80\x93 dislocations of joints, fractures of the skull \xe2\x80\x93 as if she fell from a high surface. <br><br> Cancer has been documented to have existed since ancient Egypt, and when the circumstances are conducive, MRIs are being used for further understanding. Dr. Mislav Carka, a medical doctor at the University of Zagreb, used an MRI on a 29,000-year-old male mummy and detected a rare form of cancer. </p><p> <strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="http://rt.com/news/neanderthal-denisovan-dna-humans-770/">Bone mystery: Did ancient humans have sex with other species than Neanderthals?</a> </p><p> Letyagin and Savelov said the MRI showed the princess also suffered from osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone or bone marrow, from childhood or adolescence. <br><br> But how did the young princess cope with what must have been excruciating pain? Dr. Natalia Polosmak, the archeologist who found the remarkable human remains in 1993, said she likely used some analgesics. <br><br> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>In ancient cultures, from which there is a written testimony, such analgesics used were wine, hashish, opium, henbane, and extract of mandrake, aconite and Indian hemp. The Pazyryks knew hemp and its features</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. <br><br> In fact, the princess\xe2\x80\x99 chamber did contain cannabis. <br><br><em>\xe2\x80\x9cProbably for this sick woman, sniffing cannabis was a forced necessity</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d said Polosmak. \xe2\x80\x9c<em>And she was often in an altered state of mind. We can suggest that through her the ancestral spirits and gods could speak</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p> Though she is often referred to as a princess, the archaeologist thinks the woman might have been a shaman, as her remains were discovered in a tumuli or Kurgan, and buried in a similar style reserved usually for royalty. </p><p> The excavation and study of the woman\'s remains have been surrounded by controversy locally, as some Altay elders believe that disturbing her tomb has angered her spirit and caused natural disasters. </p><p> <strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="http://rt.com/news/181308-siberian-ice-maiden-bury/">Siberian elders vote to bury 2,500yo mummy to stop quakes, floods</a> </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/news/virus-siberia-permafrost-france-776/"></a> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/196360-panetta-memoir-north-korea/</guid><title><![CDATA[Panetta reveals US nuke strike plans on N.

It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reassure them, only makes them think having the US bull in their china shop is maybe not such a good idea.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> <br><br> Others said Panetta did not write anything unexpected. A \xe2\x80\x98Joint Vision\xe2\x80\x99 statement signed between US-South Korea in 2009 <em>\xe2\x80\x9creferences extended deterrence to include the nuclear umbrella \xe2\x80\xa6 in many respects, the information is not new,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Korea expert at the Naval War College Terence Roehrig said. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe United States has long had a position that South Korea was under the US nuclear umbrella.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> <br><br> The US sent over tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula in 1958, but their deployment was only revealed in mid-1970s. <br><br> The Korean War took place in 1950-1953, with no peace deal ever signed between North and South Korea. Thus the two countries remain technically at war. </p><h2> High-level military talks </h2><p> Meanwhile, the relationship between the North and the South remain tense. On Wednesday senior-level military talks were held between them to resolve a series of recent live-fire incidents in South Korea and maritime borders, AFP quoted Seoul\xe2\x80\x99s Defense Ministry as saying. <br><br> The meeting was referred to as the highest-level military exchange in seven years.

Offices in Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York, and Washington DC were affected. </p><p> Among the affected employees were those involved in the production of several television shows. For example, Christiane Amanpour\xe2\x80\x99s entire New York City staff was laid off \xe2\x80\x93 although the London-based correspondent will still retain workers based overseas. </p><p> HLN host Jane Velez-Mitchell and her staff were also made redundant, according to a report by <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/cnn-massive-layoffs-underway-entertainment-unit-disbanded-developing/" target="_blank">The Wrap</a>. </p><p> CNN\xe2\x80\x99s entire entertainment news division \xe2\x80\x93 which is responsible for covering topics like awards shows \xe2\x80\x93 was also shut down. Some staff were reportedly moved to other departments, while others lost their jobs completely. </p><p> While about 130 people accepted buyouts from Turner in exchange for stepping down, another 170 were made redundant, according to Capital New York. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe changes this week are difficult yet necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> CNN said in a statement. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cOut of respect for our colleagues directly impacted, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be commenting on specific people or programs.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> However, many more layoffs are expected, since company executives have said that some 1,475 positions will be eliminated over the next few weeks. </p><p> </p><p> The layoffs <em>\xe2\x80\x9care at all levels of the company\'s news, entertainment, kids, young adult and sports networks and businesses, as well as corporate functions, in 18 Turner locations around the world,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Turner Broadcasting CEO John Martin said in a letter to employees, as quoted by <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/10/06/media/turner-broadcasting-reductions/" target="_blank">CNN Money.</a> </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThose whose jobs are impacted will receive every consideration and the respect they are due, starting with severance pay for transition,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Martin continued. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever their job title, business unit or location, they have contributed to the success story that is Turner Broadcasting, and they leave with our thanks and sincere best wishes.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Notably, news of the layoffs comes as CNN continues to post profit margins between 30 and 55 percent, according to the <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/09/cutbacks-at-cnn-highlight-the-cable-news-paradox/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center\xe2\x80\x99s</a> Jesse Holcomb.

Once in custody, the two both gave confessions naming each other as the gunman, but soon afterwards began asserting their innocence. The teenagers were ultimately convicted of kidnapping, armed robbery, and murder, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. <br><br> Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson said on Wednesday that there was not a single piece of evidence that connected the two 16-year-old suspects to the crime \xe2\x80\x93 except for their brief confessions, which prosecutors have now concluded were false, according to the New York Daily News. <br><br><em>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the interest of justice, I will ask the Court today to vacate the murder convictions of David McCallum and Willie Stuckey.

A parole board doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rule on guilt or innocence, and if a convict does apologize for a crime they didn\xe2\x80\x99t do, they will be seen as a liar for having held out all through the years of the sentence. <br><br> Since taking office 10 months ago, District Attorney Thompson has vacated 10 cases for wrongful convictions.

Air is sucked in through one end and comes out the other at varying speeds. It creates an air blade that simply redirects the rain away from you. </p><p> <br><iframe src="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1243275397/air-umbrella/widget/video.html" scrolling="no" height="360" width="480" frameborder="0"></iframe> </p><p> Developers say they had been working on various types for a while, but it was only a July-August 2012 prototype developed with postgraduates from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in China that did the trick of protecting one, even two, people from the rain. <br><br> Still, that particular sample was too big, as it needed large amounts of air to redirect outward. The better version of that model was achieved later with the help of PhDs from Beihang University. <br><br> According to the team, Model A will be marketed towards women. It is 12 inches long and lasts for only 15 minutes. Model B will be 20 inches long and work for up to half an hour. Model C is extendable to 32 inches and also boasts 30 minutes of power. <br><br> Taking this into consideration, the umbrella\'s weight is not its only weakness. The fact that the product only functions for half an hour at best raises questions as to why it has gained so much traction among funders. </p><p> </p><p> Critics have additionally added that the potential for noisiness is incredibly high, while its presence in everyday households would mean the existence of a further item that needs to be charged on a regular basis. <br><br> It is not the first time that an idea to create such a device has appeared, though this is the first one to be marketed. Quentin Debaene\'s "AIRBLOW 2050" umbrella concept even won the James Dyson Award for design in 2013. <br><br> The French student pledged to reinvent the umbrella, giving plenty of reasons \xe2\x80\x93 fabric gets wet; umbrellas tend to turn inside out from strong wind; puddles of water are made by wet umbrellas indoors and, of course, they get in people\xe2\x80\x99s faces. <br><br> It was Debaene who proposed the motorized design by using Dyson\xe2\x80\x99s (the vacuum cleaner brand) Airblade technology. He expressed a wish for it to be operational by 2050, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why the design flaws existing now (like the fact that it won\xe2\x80\x99t offer 100 percent protection at an angle) can\xe2\x80\x99t be ironed out by then. <br><br> Meanwhile, the Air Umbrella project on Kickstarter closes on October 24, and the creators claim their device works just fine \xe2\x80\x93 but they need more time to improve their product, including its appearance and auxiliary function (including a power display function and mobile power supply function). <br><br> Those seeking to get one as a Christmas present may be in luck \xe2\x80\x93 but only next year, as shipping is slated for December 2015. And if anything goes wrong, the team promises a money-back guarantee. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/196304-nimr-shia-execution-saudi/</guid><title><![CDATA[Saudi Shia leader sentenced to death for role in anti-govt protests]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/196304-nimr-shia-execution-saudi/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/ed/00/00/nimr-shia-execution-saudi.jpg" title="A protester holds up a picture of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr (Reuters / Stringer)"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 23:25:24 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/ed/00/00/nimr-shia-execution-saudi.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Sheik Nimr al-Nimr, a figurehead of the Shia minority protests that have rumbled in Saudi Arabia since 2011, was sentenced to death on Wednesday, his brother announced on Twitter.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/ed/00/00/nimr-shia-execution-saudi.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A protester holds up a picture of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr (Reuters / Stringer)" /> <p> Mohammed al-Nimr said his brother was found guilty by a Riyadh court of <em>\xe2\x80\x9cencouraging foreign meddling\xe2\x80\x9d</em> from Iran, and disobeying the government with armed resistance. The verdict was the conclusion of a trial that began in March 2013, according to news agencies. <br><br> Al-Nimr and his family have claimed that the influential cleric espouses a <em>"peaceful and non-violent approach,"</em> and have called the verdict <em>\xe2\x80\x9cpolitical.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> <br><br><em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe death sentence will shock everyone here and it will reduce very much the credibility of the state among Shiites. I think the government is giving a show of strength against anyone who thinks of opposition,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Tawfiq al-Seif, a community leader in Qatif \xe2\x80\x93 the eastern heartland of the protests that were sparked by the Arab Spring over three years ago \xe2\x80\x93 told Reuters. <br><br> Prosecutors had asked for al-Nimr \xe2\x80\x93 who had been dubbed <em>\xe2\x80\x9cmentally unstable\xe2\x80\x9d</em> by a government minister \xe2\x80\x93 to be executed by crucifixion, which involves a beheading, followed by a public display of the body. But it is unclear if this is the form of execution due to be used, as Mohammed al-Nimr said that his brother had avoided the charge of hadd al-haraba, or insurgency, the punishment for which is a public display of the convict\xe2\x80\x99s dead body. <br><br><em>\xe2\x80\x9cProbably they want to show people the sword but not actually use it,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Seif speculated. <br><br> Last year, international group Human Rights Watch said that Nimr al-Nimr had not received appropriate medical care during his detention, and was denied access to a qualified defense team during his trial. The organization summarized the actions of the Saudi legal system \xe2\x80\x93 which has no penal code \xe2\x80\x93 as <em>\xe2\x80\x9cunfair\xe2\x80\x9d</em> and <em>\xe2\x80\x9carbitrary,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> adding that its propensity for <em>\xe2\x80\x9coutrageous and gruesome punishments\xe2\x80\x9d</em> did not comply with any international standards. <br><br> Al-Nimr and his Shia supporters \xe2\x80\x93 who are thought to number between five and 20 percent of the population and are concentrated in the oil-rich east of the country \xe2\x80\x93 say they have no voice in the Sunni-dominated kingdom, and are financially neglected by Riyadh. <br><br> But the government has not been keen to make concessions. <br><br> After brutally putting down the initial wave of demonstrations, government forces shot al-Nimr multiple times during his capture in 2012, and killed three more Shia protesters during the suppression of rallies that followed.

In contrast, the previous week saw the area targeted roughly half a dozen times a day. </p><p> The intensified campaign, which has become increasingly effective due to intelligence and on-the-ground coordination with Kurdish fighters, has resulted in at least 32 IS militants being killed in that 48-hour period. </p><p> It has also paid dividends for Kurdish fighters who were at risk of being engulfed by the IS advance within <em>\xe2\x80\x9ca matter of days.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> On Wednesday, a black IS flag raised on a hill overlooking Kobani was torn down after militants were targeted by coalition air strikes. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Isis in Kobani: Black flag is torn down as Kurdish fighters capture hill overlooking Kobani in symbolic victory . <a href="http://t.co/4gytz3KX2R">pic.twitter.com/4gytz3KX2R</a> </p> <p> \xe2\x80\x94 Sabah Mustafa (@Sabah_Salh) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sabah_Salh/status/522350842545180673">October 15, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> The symbolic move stands in sharp contrast to the situation on October 6, when thousands fled the city after the black Islamic State flag was raised over a building on the outskirts of the city, signaling the militants\xe2\x80\x99 rapid advance. <br><br> The US military, however, has stressed that the situation on the ground remains \xe2\x80\x9cfluid,\xe2\x80\x9d with the dramatically outgunned Kurds holding out far longer than many analysts had predicted. <br><br> Roughly a third of the city remains under IS control, <a href="http://rt.com/news/195168-isis-kobani-video-insider/" target="_blank">with intense</a> street-by-street battles tearing through Kobani on a daily basis. </p><p> The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said fierce clashes erupted on Tuesday in Kobani\xe2\x80\x99s eastern neighborhoods and on the southern edge of the city. </p><p> Despite the continued IS advance, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said in a report that the airstrikes have put a significant dent in the Islamic State\'s ability to produce and smuggle oil \xe2\x80\x93 a major source of finance for the militants, according to The Independent. </p><p> </p><h2> \xe2\x80\x98Inherent Resolve\xe2\x80\x99 </h2><p> A US military commander announced Wednesday that the campaign against IS has been named \'Operation Inherent Resolve.\' </p><p> The United States and five Arab countries first initiated the Syrian campaign in September, following a string of recorded beheadings of Westerners by IS militants. </p><p> The US and several other Western states, including the UK, are also carrying out airstrikes in neighboring Iraq, where IS has also seized large swaths of territory. The Iraq campaign started on August 8. </p><p> The Obama administration now says that 60 countries in total are taking part in US-led efforts to defeat the militant group, which it says it has established a \xe2\x80\x9ccaliphate\xe2\x80\x9d on Iraqi and Syrian territory. <br><br> On Tuesday, US President Barack Obama met with top brass from 20 countries to work out military options on further stemming the tide of the Islamic State\'s advance. <br><br> Obama is also scheduled to hold a video conference on Wednesday with British, French, German, and Italian leaders, during which IS is set to top the agenda, the White House said. <br><br> The US president, along with his Western partners, have all ruled out the possibility of engaging in ground operations. </p><p> Several countries, however, have already worked in an advisory capacity. So far, the US has an estimated 1,400 military personnel in Iraq, largely concentrated in Baghdad, to tackle the IS threat. On Tuesday, British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon <a href="http://rt.com/uk/196108-troops-train-syrian-rebels/" target="_blank">said</a> the UK is considering training moderate Syrian rebels to battle IS. </p><p> </p><p> Fallon\xe2\x80\x99s comments came just days after the UK Defence Ministry said a team of a dozen men had been <a href="http://rt.com/uk/195304-britian-trainers-kurds-isis/" target="_blank">dispatched</a> to northern Iraq to train Kurdish fighters to use heavy machine guns which the UK supplied to them in September. German troops are also on the ground in small numbers working as advisors. </p><p> Earlier, the Shia-dominated Iraqi government expressed opposition to Sunni-led Gulf Arab states playing any part in the intervention against IS militants in the country. Recently, however, the Iraqi government appears increasingly uneasy about the growing presence of Western boots on the ground. </p><p> On Wednesday, a 200-strong contingent of Australian special forces intended to advise military forces in Iraq remained stuck in the United Arab Emirates amid rumblings from Baghdad that they are not welcome. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are absolutely against foreign military bases and the presence of foreign military forces. Yes, we did ask for help, but it concerned air cover,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> newly appointed Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim Al-Jaafari told RT. </p><p> Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott promised the issue would be settled within a matter of days. </p><p> Meanwhile, French President Francois Hollande said on Tuesday that France would continue delivering arms \xe2\x80\x93 especially \xe2\x80\x9cadapted weaponry\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 to Kurdish forces in Syria. He did not, however, specify the details of those weapons. Despite being part of the US coalition, France is not participating in the airstrikes. </p><p> </p><h2> The Turkish question </h2><p> Turkey \xe2\x80\x93 which participated in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s talks with Obama but did not send its highest ranking general \xe2\x80\x93 has resisted pressure to become involved inside Syria or allow the US military to use its bases to launch airstrikes, <a href="http://rt.com/news/195396-turkey-us-isis-airbase/" target="_blank">despite reports</a> to the contrary. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan previously said that Ankara would only intervene in Syria with the explicit goal of toppling the government of Bashar Assad. </p><p> Turkey, along with France, has suggested setting up a no-fly zone and buffer zone on Syrian soil to protect refugees in northern Syria. </p><p> On Wednesday, Syria called the proposal a <em>\xe2\x80\x9cgross violation\xe2\x80\x9d</em> of the UN Charter and international law, and rejected it <em>\xe2\x80\x9cunder any pretext.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Unlike Iraq, whose permission was at least nominally sought out before military operations began in the country, the US-led coalition began operations in Syria without obtaining permission from Damascus. </p><p> Meanwhile, Turkish inaction has triggered riots among the country\xe2\x80\x99s 15 million-strong Kurdish minority, leading to the deaths of at least 35 people in clashes last week. <br><br> Tensions continued to soar on Monday, when Turkish warplanes <a href="http://rt.com/news/195824-turkey-bomb-kurdish-pkk/" target="_blank">bombed</a> Kurdistan Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Party (PKK) targets near the country\xe2\x80\x99s border with Iraq. </p><p> Turkey says the bombings came in response to three days of attacks on the Dagl\xc4\xb1ca military guard post in Hakkari province. The PKK, a Turkish Kurdish party that has fought for greater Kurdish autonomy within Turkey for nearly three decades, accused Ankara of violating a March 2013 ceasefire with the airstrikes. </p><p> Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed leader of PKK, threatened to call off peace talks if Ankara did not intervene on behalf of Kurds in Kobani by Wednesday. </p><p> Earlier this month, Erdogan said that IS and the PKK are equally worthy of contempt in the eyes of Turkey. </p><p> <em>"It is wrong to consider them [IS and PKK] in different ways,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Erdogan said. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to handle them all together on a common ground."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/196328-egypt-warplanes-bomb-libya/</guid><title><![CDATA[\xe2\x80\x98Battle for Egypt\xe2\x80\x99: Cairo warplanes \xe2\x80\x98bomb Libya\xe2\x80\x99s Islamists\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/196328-egypt-warplanes-bomb-libya/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/ee/80/00/egypt-warplanes-bomb-libya.jpg" title="An Egyptian Air Force Mirage fighter jet (Reuters / Amr Abdallah Dalsh)"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 22:08:10 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/ee/80/00/egypt-warplanes-bomb-libya.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Egyptian warplanes have reportedly begun bombing Benghazi targets in an attempt to pry Islamist militants away from strongholds in eastern Libya, AP reports, citing unnamed officials.

The country\xe2\x80\x99s government is no longer operating out of the Libyan capital Tripoli, however, as they were driven out by militants associated with various Islamist groups. Instead, the administration now governs out of Tobruk in eastern Libya. </p><p> </p><p> The sources said that newly trained Libyan troops on the ground will ultimately take part in efforts to combat the Islamists, though they are not doing so just yet. Despite reportedly coordinating with a new Libyan chief of staff, the officials also stated specifically that the bombing campaign is in the interest of Egypt. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a battle for Egypt not Libya,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> one of the quoted officials said. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cEgypt was the first country in the region to warn against terrorism and it is also the first to fight it.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/news/195196-libya-crisis-un-refugees/">READ MORE: Libyan crisis pushes number of refugees to 300,000 - UN</a> </p><p> Although Egyptian planes may be involved in the bombing, Libyan lawmaker Tareq al-Jourshi said they were \xe2\x80\x9crented\xe2\x80\x9d by the country and Libyan pilots were flying them. </p><p> News of the purported air campaign also comes as <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/15/libya-security-oil-idUSL6N0SA4QZ20141015" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reported rocket attacks against a chemical storage tank in Benghazi. The tank \xe2\x80\x93 which housed various pipeline cleaning chemicals for the Libyan oil company al-Jour \xe2\x80\x93 was struck by rockets that were likely launched by a plane, according to the deputy head of Libya\xe2\x80\x99s oil workers union, Saad al-Fakhri. </p><p> </p><p> Meanwhile, an unnamed Islamist militia commander told AP that there is evidence showing Egyptian warplanes are taking off from another city and bombing various targets. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have photographs of the Egyptian warplanes and Egyptian naval forces stationed in eastern cities,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> he said. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Egyptians are bombing us day and night and only want to seed divisions among us here.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Despite denying its involvement on state media, Egypt has in the past expressed its backing for the administration now in Tobruk, arguing the Islamist factions fighting for control of the neighboring country present an explicit threat to its national security. </p><p> These militias \xe2\x80\x93 which helped bring down Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 \xe2\x80\x93 have expanded to fill in the vacuum created by the new central government\xe2\x80\x99s lacking military and police forces, and have pressed forward with attempts to take control of the country themselves. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/196324-yellow-fever-mosquito-los-angeles/</guid><title><![CDATA[Yellow fever mosquitoes spread fear of deadly viruses in Los Angeles]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/196324-yellow-fever-mosquito-los-angeles/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/ee/40/00/yellow-fever-mosquito-los-angeles.jpg" title="Image from wikipedia.org"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 21:27:27 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/ee/40/00/yellow-fever-mosquito-los-angeles.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Ebola may not be the only cause of fear to arrive in the US recently. Yellow fever mosquitoes \xe2\x80\x92 which can transmit dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever itself \xe2\x80\x92 have been found in the Los Angeles region, officials announced Wednesday.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/ee/40/00/yellow-fever-mosquito-los-angeles.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Image from wikipedia.org" /> <p> These mosquitoes can spread the three deadly tropical viruses to humans through their bites. They were found Oct. 7 and 8 in Commerce and Pico Rivera, respectively, according to the Greater Los Angeles County Vector Control District (GLACVCD) and San Gabriel Valley Mosquito &amp; Vector Control District (SGVMVCD). </p><p> </p><p> Like <a href="http://rt.com/trends/ebola-outbreak/" target="_blank">Ebola</a>, yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease. However, instead of being spread by bodily fluids, it is carried in the salivary glands of a mosquito. The \xe2\x80\x98yellow\xe2\x80\x99 in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients, according to the World Health Organization. The virus is endemic in tropical areas of Africa and Latin America, and there are an estimated 200 000 cases of yellow fever, causing 30 000 deaths, worldwide each year, with 90 percent occurring in Africa. </p><p> Dengue virus is a leading cause of illness and death in the tropics and subtropics, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas, with as many as 400 million people infected yearly, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The infection causes flu-like illness, and occasionally develops into a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue (also known as Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever), according to the WHO. </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/usa/166024-usa-incurable-chikungunya-virus/" target="_blank">Chikungunya</a> is a viral disease that causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash, similar to dengue, which can cause misdiagnosis in areas where both viruses are common. Since 2004, chikungunya fever has reached epidemic proportions, with considerable morbidity and suffering, the WHO said. Most patients recover fully, but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months, or even years. Occasional cases of eye, neurological and heart complications have been reported, as well as gastrointestinal complaints. Chikungunya occurs in Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent. </p><p> The first reported case of <a href="http://rt.com/usa/173772-mosquito-virus-florida-chikungunya/" target="_blank">chikungunyain the US</a> was reported July 17 in Florida. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThis newly reported case represents the first time that mosquitoes in the continental United States are thought to have spread the virus to a non-traveler,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> the CDC announced. </p><p> Now the viruses spread by the yellow fever mosquito could potentially arrive clear across the country from Florida. </p><p> <em>"While these debilitating viruses, so far, aren\'t locally transmitted in LA County, the mosquitoes that can transmit them are now here,"</em> Susanne Kluh, director of scientific-technical services, said in a statement. <em>"Infected travelers can bring these viruses to Los Angeles County."</em> </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the latest in a series of identified mosquito introductions into the southland,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Levy Sun, the GLACVCD\xe2\x80\x99s public information officer said in the district\xe2\x80\x99s joint statement with SGVMVCD. </p><p> The Aedes aegypti species, better known as the yellow fever mosquito, has black and white stripes and grows to about a quarter-inch in size. It is primarily a forest species that has become adapted to rural, suburban and urban human environments. In recent decades Aedes albopictus has spread from Asia to Africa, the Americas and Europe, notably aided by the international trade in used tires as mosquitoes deposit their eggs in tires containing rainwater, the WHO said. </p><p> </p><p> The Aedes albopictus species \xe2\x80\x92 the Asian tiger mosquito \xe2\x80\x92 is a native of Southeast Asia, and was first identified in El Monte and South El Monte, Calif. in September 2011. Since then, this mosquito has spread to 10 neighboring cities despite aggressive measures to eradicate the population, the vector control districts said. It also spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. </p><p> The Australian backyard mosquito (Aedes notoscriptus), a native of Australia, was found in two neighborhoods in Montebello and Monterey Park this summer. It can transmit canine heartworm and is the primary transmitter of the Barmah Forest and Ross River viruses in Oz. </p><p> All three mosquitoes are aggressive day-biting mosquitoes that thrive in urban environments because they prefer to lay eggs in small man-made containers that hold water. </p><p> The two vector control districts are working closely with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, which tracks imported human diseases. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cBoth agencies have specialized teams that target these invasive species,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> said Jason Farned, public information officer at SGVMVCD. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re aggressively attacking the populations wherever we find them.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Officials are asking residents to report any sightings of the small, black-and-white mosquitoes, especially if someone is bitten during the day. They are also requesting people dump and drain all stagnant water, and to <em>\xe2\x80\x9cthoroughly scrub\xe2\x80\x9d</em> places susceptible to standing water on a weekly basis. </p><p> The districts have not determined how the yellow fever mosquito or either of the other disease-transmitting biters arrived in California. Along with imported tires, plants are typically to blame, officials noted. The bugs can also travel via planes, ships and other vehicles. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/196316-times-square-weed-expo/</guid><title><![CDATA[Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s Times Square hosts Cannabis Business Expo]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/196316-times-square-weed-expo/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/ed/c0/00/manhattan__s-times-square-hosts-cannabis-business-expo.jpg" title="Reuters / Eduardo Munoz"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 21:02:42 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/ed/c0/00/manhattan__s-times-square-hosts-cannabis-business-expo.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Investors, businessmen and at least one state senator were among the 900 or so attendees that turned up at a Times Square hotel in Manhattan this week for the International Cannabis Association\xe2\x80\x99s first ever conference in New York.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/ed/c0/00/manhattan__s-times-square-hosts-cannabis-business-expo.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Eduardo Munoz" /> <p> <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/pot-business-conference-draws-hundreds-hoping-u-legalize-125446532--sector.html" target="_blank">Reuters reported</a> this week that around 300 attendees paid $500 apiece to attend the Cannabis Business Expo at the Times Square Marriott Marquis, but a spokesperson for ICA, the organization that hosted its first East Coast Cannabis Business Expo from Saturday through Monday, said as many as 900 people turned out to learn about the budding marijuana business that has grown especially in recent months following the passing of laws in Colorado and Washington that lets adults there legally purchase pot for recreational purchases. </p><p> Fortune Magazine <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/10/14/high-hopes-5-pot-companies-looking-to-hit-it-big/" target="_blank">reported</a> from the expo that attendees sat through seminars like \xe2\x80\x9cSeed to Sale Tracking\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cEmployment Law Issues Arising out of Medical Marijuana Use\xe2\x80\x9d to learn more about a topic that remains relatively taboo but has found itself closer to the mainstream than ever before in recent months. State Senator Diane Savino (D), a sponsor of New York\xe2\x80\x99s medical marijuana bill, also was on hand, Fortune reported, to speak at the conference and host a campaign fundraiser. </p><p> While Colorado and Washington are currently the only places in the United States where adults aren\xe2\x80\x99t subjected to a pot prohibition, the District of Columbia and 23 states from coast-to-coast have passed measures in recent years that allow residents to enjoy cannabis for medical purposes. Should the experiments underway in Colorado and Washington prove successful, then more states may soon adopt measures loosening restrictions on weed. If that does occur, however, then an currently nonexistent infrastructure will have to be mostly built from the ground up, which is one of the reasons in particular that hundreds flocked to this week\xe2\x80\x99s expo. </p><p> <em>"We think that in a few years you\'re going to look at cannabis as a commodity the same way that you look at corn or wheat,"</em> Steve Janjic, the chief executive officer at Amercanex, told Reuters.

Brian Kelsey sponsored the resolution putting the amendment on the ballot and heads the \'Yes on 3\' committee urging its ratification. He said not having an income tax makes Tennessee <em>"more fiscally responsible"</em> and that permanently banning one would appeal to businesses, according to the Associated Press. </p><p> <em>"Not having an income tax has already brought jobs to Tennessee, and permanently banning an income tax will bring even more jobs to the state,"</em> Kelsey said. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Vote "Yes On 3 = Income Tax Free"- <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianKelsey">@BrianKelsey</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TNGOP">@TNGOP</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/HamCoTN">@HamCoTN</a> <a href="http://t.co/c6E2Pl2kBO">pic.twitter.com/c6E2Pl2kBO</a> </p> <p> \xe2\x80\x94 Bo Watson (@SenBoWatson) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenBoWatson/status/521704541985976320">October 13, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> Currently Tennessee has the so-called <em>\xe2\x80\x9cHall tax,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> which is a six percent tax on interest and dividends, but doesn\'t tax income. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe state constitution gives the government the right to tax property as well as income from stocks and bonds, but it does not mention personal income,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> the Motley Fool noted. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cEvery so often lawmakers try to institute an income tax, as the constitution does not specifically bar this.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> There is also a seven percent sales tax. In 2011, the average per-capita state and local tax paid was the second-lowest in the US at $2,777, according to the Tax Foundation. </p><p> Until 1999, it was widely thought that the state constitution already banned an income tax, Ben Cunningham, spokesman for Tennessee Tax Revolt, a Tea Party-allied group pushing the amendment, told the Washington Examiner. But that year, the state attorney general issued an opinion saying that because the state taxed dividend and interest income, it could also adopt a regular income tax. </p><p> In 2001, then-Gov. Don Sundquist, a Republican, moved to adopt an income tax, saying the state needed additional revenue to balance the budget. His plan proposed a four percent income tax with a $7,000-per-person exemption and was coupled with a reduced sales tax rate and abolishing the sales tax on food. That attempt failed in 2002 after protests outside the statehouse in Nashville, which included a brick being thrown through the window of the governor\'s office and demonstrators banging on the doors of the Senate chamber while lawmakers attempted to go about their business inside. </p><p> Republican state Sen. Rusty Crowe told the Johnson City Press that the amendment is directly related to Sundquist\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to impose an income tax. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cSome of us that read the Tennessee Constitution know that we tax privileges, not rights,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Crowe said. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cFrom time to time in our state\xe2\x80\x99s history, a general income tax has been proposed and challenged in the Tennessee Supreme Court. Each time it was ruled unconstitutional. I think Sundquist felt he could get enough votes from the bench to change that.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Kelsey\xe2\x80\x99s proposed constitutional amendment reads: </p><blockquote> <p> Shall Article II, Section 28 of the Constitution of Tennessee be amended by adding the following sentence at the end of the final substantive paragraph within the section: Notwithstanding the authority to tax privileges or any other authority set forth in this Constitution, the Legislature shall not levy, authorize or otherwise permit any state or local tax upon payroll or earned personal income or any state or local tax measured by payroll or earned personal income; however, nothing contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting any tax in effect on January 1, 2011, or adjustment of the rate of such tax. </p> </blockquote><p> That provision would allow the continuation of the state\'s Hall tax. </p><p> Opponents of Amendment 3 believe that a personal income tax would limit the options of future generations and could help reduce taxes overall. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a referendum on whether or not to have an income tax or a payroll tax but it is a question on whether we should enshrine in the constitution a limitation on future decisions that voters may feel the need to decide. It may be an emergency or something,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Dick Williams of Citizens for Fiscal Sanity, a group opposing Amendment 3, told the Memphis Commercial Appeal. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cWe believe that passing this amendment will inevitably lead to either higher sales taxes or higher businesses taxes, and on the local level, higher property taxes,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> he continued. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIf things got serious and this amendment got enshrined, possibly a statewide property tax could be considered.

It\'s turning out to be an easy and straightforward spacecraft to fly, at least so far. It really looks as if we\'re headed for an exciting science mission."</em> </p><p> <em>"All the instruments have been turned on and are operating very well,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Jakosky added to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-mars-maven-orbiter-healthy-set-for-climate-study/" target="_blank">CBS News</a>. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe aim of our activities right now is to get to the start of science mapping, and that will be in early- to mid-November, depending on whether we encounter any problems.

MAVEN is equipped with an Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph, or IUVAS, that monitors the sunlight reflected off of those molecules and, according to NASA, is already revealing new details about the planet\xe2\x80\x99s history. </p><p> Additionally, other sensors on MAVEN have already, according to scientists, collected details on solar energetic particles, or SEPs, emitted by the sun during solar flares, which is also expected to provide NASA with new details about Mars. </p><p> <em>"With these observations, MAVEN\'s IUVS has obtained the most complete picture of the extended Martian upper atmosphere ever made,"</em> MAVEN Remote Sensing Team member Mike Chaffin added. <em>"By measuring the extended upper atmosphere of the planet, MAVEN directly probes how these atoms escape to space. The observations support our current understanding that the upper atmosphere of Mars, when compared to Venus and Earth, is only tenuously bound by the Red Planet\'s weak gravity."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/196292-russia-sanctions-isolation-putin/</guid><title><![CDATA[Putin: Russia\xe2\x80\x99s isolation is \xe2\x80\x98absurd & illusory goal\xe2\x80\x99]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/196292-russia-sanctions-isolation-putin/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/ec/40/00/russia-sanctions-isolation-putin.jpg" title="Russian  President Vladimir Putin (RIA Novosti / Alexey Druzhinin)"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 19:03:26 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/ec/40/00/russia-sanctions-isolation-putin.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Trying to isolate Russia with sanctions and restrictive measures is \xe2\x80\x9can absurd and illusory goal,\xe2\x80\x9d Russia\xe2\x80\x99s president has said.

If there is no agreement reached between Russia and Ukraine, Europe will face serious energy shortages. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cI would like to stress that Russia is meeting its obligations in full with regard to gas supplies to European consumers,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Putin said. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cWe intend to further deepen our cooperation with the EU in the energy sector, where we are natural partners, on a transparent and predictable basis.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Putin agreed that <em>\xe2\x80\x9cthe problem of transit\xe2\x80\x9d</em> of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s gas to Europe across Ukrainian territory <em>\xe2\x80\x9cremains.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> One of the <em>\xe2\x80\x9cobvious solutions,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> the Russian president said, <em>\xe2\x80\x9cmight be to diversify the delivery routes.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIn this regard, we hope that the European Commission will finally make a decision in the nearest future about the use of the OPAL gas pipeline at full capacity,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> he said. </p><p> OPAL (Ostsee Pipeline Anbindungs-Leitung) is a 470-kilometre transit pipeline, which links Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Nord Stream and Europe bypassing transit countries as it runs Russian natural gas across Germany to the Czech Republic and further. </p><p> </p><p> Gazprom has asked the European Commission to exclude OPAL from the Third Energy Package, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow one single company to both produce and transport oil and gas. </p><p> Unblocking the South Stream pipeline will also <em>\xe2\x80\x9csignificantly contribute to integrated energy security in Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIt will benefit everybody, Russia as well as European consumers, including Serbia,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Putin said. </p><p> President Putin was also asked about relations between Russia and the US. In his response Putin stressed that Russia always aimed for <em>\xe2\x80\x9copen partnership relations with the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIn return, however, we have seen various reservations and attempts to interfere in our domestic affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Putin said. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cEverything that has happened since the beginning of this year is even more disturbing.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Current bilateral relations between the two states the president described as <em>\xe2\x80\x9cnothing but hostile.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cNow, President Barack Obama in his <a href="http://rt.com/news/190392-russia-lavrov-obama-threat-speech/" target="_blank">speech</a> at the UN General Assembly named the \xe2\x80\x98Russian aggression in Europe\xe2\x80\x99 as one of the three major threats facing humanity today, alongside the deadly Ebola virus and the Islamic State.

A lawsuit filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, became the class action <a href="http://rt.com/usa/nypd-evidence-arrest-quotas-570/">case</a> against stop-and-frisk. </p><p> </p><p> Former mayor Michael Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s administration appealed US district court judge Shira Scheindlin\xe2\x80\x99s ruling against the policing tactic. His successor, Bill de Blasio, took office in January and later decided to drop the appeal. The unions now say they want to resume that appeal. </p><p> The <a href="http://rt.com/usa/nypd-stop-frisk-targeted-minorities-190/">racial profiling</a> associated with the program created much animosity between city communities and the police department. In addition to the program\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights violations, multiple reports by the likes of the New York Civil Liberties Union and New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman found that stop-and-frisk policing in the city was <a href="http://rt.com/usa/181976-stop-frisk-ineffective-guns/">ineffective</a> in recovering firearms and dismal at securing convictions for violent crime. The studies also found that violent crime decreased as stop-and-frisk checks dropped in later years. </p><p> The federal ruling demanded reforms to the NYPD policy, overseen by a monitor. These reforms have started to materialize, including a pilot program that will <a href="http://rt.com/usa/185520-nypd-body-cameras-reform/" target="_blank">supply body cameras</a> to officers in five precincts. </p><p> In 2011, the stop-and-frisk policy hit a peak of 685,000 stops. In the first half of 2014, there have been 27,527 stops total, according to the NYPD. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/196264-turkish-arabic-engine-investigation/</guid><title><![CDATA[\xe2\x80\x8bTurkish Airlines conducts probe after panic over Arabic inscriptions on engines]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/196264-turkish-arabic-engine-investigation/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/ea/80/00/44.jpg" title="AFP Photo / Safin Hamed"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 18:43:10 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/ea/80/00/44.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Turkish Airlines was forced to examine apparently random Arabic scripts found on the engines of several of its planes over the weekend, prompting fears that Islamic State militants had been defacing the jets.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/ea/80/00/44.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / Safin Hamed" /> <p> However, what people initially suspected to be disturbing propaganda messages courtesy of the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) were actually blessings for abundance and fertility. <br><br> Staff, unable to read the inscriptions, feared that IS may have been responsible, according to the Turkish website, airporthaber.com. <br><br> After one jet was found with the markings at Istanbul\xe2\x80\x99s Atat\xc3\xbcrk Airport \xe2\x80\x93 Europe\xe2\x80\x99s fifth busiest airport \xe2\x80\x93 three further planes were discovered to have similar markings \xe2\x80\x93 all of which had arrived from different starting points. <br><br> A spokesman for Turkish Airlines told Reuters on Wednesday that there had been no need for concern \xe2\x80\x93 at least, over the nature of the markings. Their very existence has, however, generally raised questions about security. <br><br><em>\xe2\x80\x9cAn investigation has been launched into this issue.

This is what you need to know about the killer virus.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/ea/c0/00/46.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Reuters / Christopher Black" /> <h2> 1. It has been here for decades </h2><p> The virus lives naturally in animals, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. The first two recorded outbreak were in 1976. The Ebola virus (EBOV) is one of five members of the Ebolavirus genus, four of which cause lethal hemorrhagic fever. It was previously called Zaire virus, after the country that is now called the Democratic Republic of Congo. </p><p> There are currently two separate Ebola outbreaks underway. In addition to the one in Western Africa, which has already spread to the US and Europe, there is another one in the Congo. </p><p> Bats are the natural reservoir of the virus, because they can carry it without getting ill. Apes can suffer from it too. Humans may get infected by eating bushmeat or through feces, after which the virus can spread from human to human via blood, saliva and other fluids. </p><p> </p><h2> 2. There is no cure </h2><p> Ebola\'s high mortality rate and gruesome symptoms have given it the air of something out of a horror movie. But statistically speaking, the virus was a minor threat, with outbreaks quickly fading out claiming a few hundred lives at most. </p><p> So it\'s not surprising that institutions researching infectious diseases never invested many resources into finding a cure, preferring to spend money on more wide-spread (and, cynically speaking, more profit-generating) threats. </p><p> The exception to that are bioweapons specialists, who concluded that the virus that could not go airborne and is an ineffective means to attack the enemy (or serve as a weapon for terrorists, for that matter). </p><p> So when the current outbreak started beating records \xe2\x80\x93 in fact killing more people than all previous outbreaks combined \xe2\x80\x93 and spreading into cities, nobody had a working treatment at hand. </p><p> A handful of experimental vaccines are in the pipeline, including three developed in Russia. But they are far from being mass produced, while the virus is spreading. </p><p> </p><h2> 3. No adequate response </h2><p> The countries affected by the current outbreak are poor, their healthcare systems are rudimentary, and the tradition-dictated hygiene habits of many of its citizens are not suitable for stopping the infection. <br> Where Western countries can rally experts in biohazard suits, quarantine every person a suspected carrier had contact with and run blood tests, countries like Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia have neither the resources nor experience to take such measures. And the problems only start with healthcare: the epidemic spreads panic, fear and violence, causing deterioration in whatever social order is in place. </p><p> The assistance from international organizations helps a lot, but it\'s not a magic wand that can stop the outbreak with a deft wave. Organizations like the WHO have their difficulties too. For instance, the UN\'s health body had its budget cut, leaving it with less than $4 billion to spend in 2013-2014. In contrast, the budget of the US agency tackling infections, the CDC, was about $6 billion in 2013. </p><p> Just like scientists researching treatments, doctors preventing them in the field have to prioritize. Ebola was not a priority, and the outbreak went under the radar for an estimated three months, before it was declared as such by Doctors Without Borders. By that time it was already in Guinea\'s capital Conakry, a city of 2 million people.</p><h2> 4. The West is not prepared </h2><p> Or at least not as well prepared as it should be! Even if Ebola manages to get into developed nations with some travelers slipping through airport cordons, the spread of the virus would not be large. It takes between four to 21 days for an infected person to become contagious, which means once a case is discovered, everyone who had contact with the person can be quarantined and tested before they can spread the disease. <br> But being among the few unlucky victims is little consolation for those who do get infected. And the fact that in the US and Spain, health workers who provided care to known Ebola sufferers got infected, despite knowing what they were dealing with, is less than reassuring. </p><p> In both countries there is criticism over how the treatment of Ebola patients is conducted and how reports of new suspected cases have been responded to.</p><h2> 5. Epidemic cost: Tens of billions of dollars </h2><p> Battling the outbreak is difficult and costly. The WHO estimates that by November there could be 10,000 new cases of the disease each week in two months, unless it\'s taken under control. </p><p> This would require having 70 percent of infected people in a care facility and 70 percent of burials done without further infections. Otherwise the breakout would reach a stage, for which there is no plan. </p><p> The World Bank says in the worst case scenario the economic damage from the epidemic could reach $33 billion. </p><p> The US Department of Defense said it needs over $1 billion to cover the cost of the effort to fight the disease in Africa. It may send as many as 3,000 soldiers to the epidemic zone, with an estimated cost of $750 million over a six-month period. </p><p> Other states, world bodies and charities have promised to chip in to stem the tide of the developing outbreak and provide aid to the most afflicted West African nations. </p><p> In September, the European Union pledged 150 million euros to fight the virus in West Africa. The World Bank Group has pledged US $230 million in emergency funding to help Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone contain the spread of Ebola infections. </p><p> Last month the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation released $50 million to the UN and other international aid agencies working to contain the epidemic. The International Committee of the Red Cross, in tandem with the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies, has set aside 34.7 million Swiss francs to tackle the epidemic as well. </p><p> The price tag of developing and distributing drugs, however, is less than one would expect. </p><p> Ripley Ballou, who heads the Ebola vaccine program for GSK, estimated the company could make 100,000 to 500,000 doses for just $25 million. The problem: it would take around 9 months. </p><p> In any such epidemic, however, the real cost comes not from the cure, but treating the consequences of human fear, WHO director general Margaret Chan said. According to Chan, 90 percent of the economic costs incurred from any such outbreak <em>"come from irrational and disorganized efforts of the public to avoid infection."</em> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/politics/official-word/196284-ukraine-putin-nazi-europe/</guid><title><![CDATA[Putin: Nazi virus \xe2\x80\x98vaccine\xe2\x80\x99 losing effect in Europe]]></title><link>http://rt.com/politics/official-word/196284-ukraine-putin-nazi-europe/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/eb/c0/00/ukraine-putin-nazi-europe.jpg" title="Russian President Vladimir Putin (RIA Novosti / Alexey Nikolsky)"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 18:30:44 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/eb/c0/00/ukraine-putin-nazi-europe.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The coup d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat in Ukraine is a worrying example of growing neo-Nazi tendencies in Eastern Europe, Russian President Vladimir Putin told a Serbian newspaper.

Why, in your view, are such commemoration events important today?</em> </p><p> <strong>Vladimir Putin:</strong> First of all, I would like to thank the Serbian leadership for the invitation to visit Serbia and take part in the celebrations commemorating the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Belgrade from occupation by Nazi Germany. </p><p> We are truly grateful to our Serbian friends for the way they treasure the memory of the Soviet soldiers who fought together with the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia against Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s occupation troops. During World War II, over 31,000 Red Army officers and soldiers were killed, wounded or went missing on the territory of former Yugoslavia. About 6,000 Soviet citizens fought against the invaders in the ranks of the National Liberation Army. Their courage brought our common victory over Nazism closer and will always be remembered by our peoples as an example of bravery, unyielding determination and selfless service to one\xe2\x80\x99s homeland. </p><p> It is hard to overestimate the importance of the upcoming events. Seventy years ago, our nations joined forces to defeat the criminal ideology of hatred for humanity, which threatened the very existence of our civilization. And today it\'s also important that people in different countries and on different continents remember what terrible consequences may result from the belief in one\xe2\x80\x99s exceptionality, attempts to achieve dubious geopolitical goals, no matter by what means, and disregard for basic norms of law and morality. We must do everything in our power to prevent such tragedies in the future. </p><p> Regrettably, in some European countries the Nazi virus \xe2\x80\x9cvaccine\xe2\x80\x9d created at the Nuremberg Tribunal is losing its effect. This is clearly demonstrated by open manifestations of neo-Nazism that have already become commonplace in Latvia and other Baltic states. The situation in Ukraine, where nationalists and other radical groups provoked an anti-constitutional coup d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat in February, causes particular concern in this respect. </p><p> </p><p> Today, it is our shared duty to combat the glorification of Nazism. We must firmly oppose the attempts to revise the results of WWII and consistently combat any forms and manifestations of racism, xenophobia, aggressive nationalism and chauvinism. </p><p> I am sure that the anniversary celebrations in Belgrade, which are to become another manifestation of the sincere friendship between our nations based on the feelings of mutual affinity and respect, on spiritual kinship, on brotherhood in arms in the years of WWII, will also contribute to addressing these challenges. We hope that the preservation of historical memory will continue to help us strengthen peace, stability and welfare of the common European space together. </p><p> <strong>Politika:</strong><em>How do you see the Russian-Serbian relations today? What has been achieved during the past 20 years and what future trends in the interaction between the two countries do you foresee?</em> </p><p> <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>: Serbia has always been and still is one of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s key partners in southeastern Europe. Our nations are united by centuries-long traditions of friendship and fruitful cooperation. Their development is fostered by common interests in such spheres as politics, the economy, culture and many others. </p><p> Today, Russian-Serbian relations are on the rise. In 2013, President of Serbia Tomislav Nikolic and I signed the Interstate Declaration on Strategic Partnership, reaffirming our shared intention to promote large-scale collaboration in all key areas. </p><p> We have maintained active political contacts to discuss relevant bilateral and international issues in the spirit of confidence and agree on joint practical steps. Our governments cooperate closely within the United Nations, OSCE, the Council of Europe and many other organizations. </p><p> We are satisfied with the consistent progress in our economic relations bolstered by the existing free trade regime between our countries. In 2013, our mutual trade grew by 15 percent amounting to $1.97 billion, and, in the first six months of 2014, it increased by another 16.5 percent to $1.2 billion. We expect it to reach $2 billion by the end of this year. </p><p> A positive trend continues in the field of investment as well. The total amount of Russian investments in Serbia has exceeded $3 billion. Most of these funds have been invested in the strategically-important energy industry. One example of successful cooperation is the energy giant Petroleum Industry of Serbia, which has turned from a loss-making enterprise into a major contributor to the Serbian state budget. The South Stream project will provide Serbia with more than 2 billion euro in new investments and significantly strengthen the country\xe2\x80\x99s energy security. </p><p> Serbia\xe2\x80\x99s rail infrastructure is being rebuilt and upgraded with the participation of the Russian Railways and our support in the form of loans. </p><p> I am pleased to see Serbian businesses play an active part in the promising Russian market. For example, they supply high-quality agricultural and industrial products. </p><p> I would like to note another important area of our bilateral cooperation. In recent years, the Russian-Serbian Humanitarian Centre in Nis has taken part in disaster response operations in the Balkans on several occasions. Last May, Russian rescuers helped to evacuate people during a severe flood. Russian Emergencies Ministry aircraft made several flights to deliver more than 140 tonnes in humanitarian aid to Serbia. </p><p> The growing mutual interest of Russian and Serbian people in our countries\xe2\x80\x99 history and culture is also evidence of deepening humanitarian relations. This autumn, Serbia is hosting Days of Russian Spiritual Culture with great success. The central event is the exhibition titled Russia and Serbia. History of Spiritual Connections, 14th-19th Century. We plan to expand cultural, educational, scientific and youth exchanges, and to promote tourism and sports events. </p><p> I am confident that my upcoming visit to Belgrade will give a new boost to the traditionally friendly Russian-Serbian relations, which will continue to grow and strengthen from year to year. </p><p> <strong>Politika:</strong><em>There is currently a great deal of speculation regarding the possible reduction in the supplies of Russian gas to Europe because of Ukraine\'s debt. Should European consumers get ready for a cold winter? What about the future of the South Stream project, which is of great interest to Serbia?</em> </p><p> <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>: First of all, I would like to stress that Russia is meeting its obligations in full with regard to gas supplies to European consumers. We intend to further deepen our cooperation with the EU in the energy sector, where we are natural partners, on a transparent and predictable basis. </p><p> </p><p> Since the beginning of the 21st century, we have successfully implemented a number of major projects together with our European partners. This includes the Nord Stream pipeline, which is an important factor in minimizing transit risks and ensuring uninterrupted gas supplies to Europe. Over recent months, Gazprom has been actively increasing gas reserves in European underground gas storage facilities. These measures are aimed to prevent transit disruptions and meet peak demand in winter. </p><p> Naturally, we are aware of the risks generated by the Ukrainian crisis. We were forced to interrupt gas supplies to Ukraine last June because the Kiev authorities refused to pay for gas supplies they had already received. In late summer and early autumn, we held a series of consultations in a three-party format with the participation of Russia, the EU and Ukraine, where we discussed possible mutually-acceptable solutions to the problem of the Ukrainian gas debt settlement, resumption of gas supplies to Ukraine - which had been stopped by the Ukrainian side itself - and continuous hydrocarbon transit to Europe. We are ready to continue constructive talks on these issues. </p><p> As for the future of Russian gas exports to Europe, the problem of transit across the Ukrainian territory remains. One of the more obvious solutions might be to diversify the delivery routes. In this regard, we hope that the European Commission will finally make a decision in the nearest future about the use of the OPAL gas pipeline at full capacity. </p><p> In addition, we need to resolve the deadlock concerning the South Stream. We are convinced that this project will significantly contribute to integrated energy security in Europe. It will benefit everybody, Russia as well as European consumers, including Serbia. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>Politika:</strong><em>In your opinion, what is the ultimate objective of the sanctions against Russia, imposed by the EU and the United States? How long will they last, in your view, and how much harm can they do to Russia?</em> </p><p> <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>: This question should be addressed to the EU and the United States, whose reasoning is hard to understand. Any unbiased person knows that it was not Russia who staged the coup d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat in Ukraine, which led to the grave internal political crisis and a split in society. An unconstitutional seizure of power was the starting point for the subsequent events, including the ones in Crimea. The people of Crimea, seeing the complexity and unpredictability of the situation and in order to protect their rights to their native language, culture and history, decided to hold a referendum in full compliance with the UN Charter, as a result of which the peninsula re-joined Russia. </p><p> Our partners should be well aware that attempts to put pressure on Russia with unilateral and illegitimate restrictive measures will not bring about a settlement, but rather impede the dialogue. How can we talk about de-escalation in Ukraine while the decisions on new sanctions are introduced almost simultaneously with the agreements on the peace process? If the main goal is to isolate our country, it\xe2\x80\x99s an absurd and illusory goal. It is obviously impossible to achieve it, but the economic health of Europe and the world can be seriously undermined. </p><p> With regard to the duration of the restriction measures, it also depends on the United States and the European Union. For our part, we will adopt a balanced approach to assessing the risks and impact of the sanctions and respond to them proceeding from our national interests. It is obvious that the decline in mutual confidence is bound to have a negative impact on both the international business climate in general and on the operation of European and American companies in Russia, bearing in mind that such companies will find it difficult to recover from reputational damage. In addition, it will make other countries think carefully whether it is wise to invest their funds in the American banking system and increase their dependence on economic cooperation with the United States. </p><p> <strong>Politika:</strong><em>What do you think the future holds for Russian-Ukrainian relations? Will the United States and Russia re-establish a strategic partnership after all that has happened, or will they build their relations in a different way?</em> </p><p> <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>: As for Russia, its relations with Ukraine have always played and will continue to play a very important role. Our nations are inextricably linked by common spiritual, cultural and civilizational roots. We were part of a single state for centuries, and that huge historical experience and millions of intertwined fates cannot be dismissed or forgotten. </p><p> Despite the current difficult stage in Russian-Ukrainian relations, we are interested in progressive, equitable and mutually-beneficial cooperation with our Ukrainian partners. In practice, this will become possible after sustainable peace and stability are achieved in Ukraine. Therefore, we hope to see an end to the protracted deep political and economic crisis. </p><p> Today, there is a real opportunity to end the armed confrontation, which actually amounts to a civil war. The first steps in this direction have already been made. It is vital to start a real intra-Ukrainian dialogue as soon as possible involving representatives from all the regions and political forces. This approach was documented in the Geneva Statement of April 17. Such a nationwide dialogue must focus on Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional structure and the future of the country, where all the citizens with no exception will live comfortably and in safety. </p><p> As for Russian-US ties, our aim has always been to build open partnership relations with the United States. In return, however, we have seen various reservations and attempts to interfere in our domestic affairs. </p><p> Everything that has happened since the beginning of this year is even more disturbing. Washington actively supported the Maidan protests, and when its Kiev henchmen antagonized a large part of Ukraine through rabid nationalism and plunged the country into a civil war, it blamed Russia for provoking the crisis. </p><p> Now President Barack Obama in his speech at the UN General Assembly named the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Russian aggression in Europe</em>\xe2\x80\x9d as one of the three major threats facing humanity today alongside with the deadly Ebola virus and the Islamic State. Together with the sanctions against entire sectors of our economy, this approach can be called nothing but hostile. </p><p> </p><p> The United States went so far as to declare the suspension of our cooperation in space exploration and nuclear energy. They also suspended the activity of the Russia-US Bilateral Presidential Commission established in 2009, which comprised 21 working groups dedicated, among other things, to combating terrorism and drug trafficking. </p><p> At the same time, this is not the first downturn in relations between our countries. We hope that our partners will realize the futility of attempts to blackmail Russia and remember what consequences discord between major nuclear powers could bring for strategic stability. For our part, we are ready to develop constructive cooperation based on the principles of equality and genuine respect for each others\' interests. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/196272-cia-arming-insurgents-effectiveness/</guid><title><![CDATA[CIA classified review: Covertly arming insurgents doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/196272-cia-arming-insurgents-effectiveness/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/eb/00/00/49.jpg" title="Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters.(Reuters / Khalil Ashawi)"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 17:54:10 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/eb/00/00/49.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Arming insurgencies around the world has rarely worked for the CIA without direct support from Americans on the ground, according to a still-classified agency review of the practice conducted during debate over arming rebels in Syria.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/eb/00/00/49.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters.(Reuters / Khalil Ashawi)" /> <p> The review, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/us/politics/cia-study-says-arming-rebels-seldom-works.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=2"> according</a> to The New York Times, was one of many Central Intelligence Agency studies commissioned in 2012 and 2013 as the Obama administration considered how to counter Syrian President Bashar Assad\xe2\x80\x99s forces amid the nation\xe2\x80\x99s civil war. </p><p> From aiding contra rebels against Nicaragua\xe2\x80\x99s Sandinista government to the <a href="http://rt.com/usa/obama-bay-pigs-secrets-year-235/" target="_blank"></a>Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba that ended in disaster, the study concluded that many attempts the spy agency has made in its 67-year history to covertly arm foreign fighters have had little success in effectively turning the outcome of a conflict, especially when there is no American ground support involved. </p><p> </p><p> The study was eventually presented to the White House, where it fueled skepticism among President Barack Obama and top advisers regarding whether to arm scattered rebel groups in Syria. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the things that Obama wanted to know was: Did this ever work?\xe2\x80\x9d</em> a former senior Obama administration official involved in the debate told the New York Times. The report, he said, <em>\xe2\x80\x9cwas pretty dour in its conclusions.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> President Obama made a brief reference to the CIA review earlier this year in an <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/27/going-the-distance-2"> interview</a> with The New Yorker, where he defended his administration against accusations that action taken to arm rebels did not happen fast enough. These allegations have been <a href="http://rt.com/usa/192940-panetta-obama-iraq-retreat/">repeated</a> since then by the likes of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s former Secretary of State <a href="http://rt.com/usa/180120-clinton-obama-criticism-syria/">Hillary Clinton</a>. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cVery early in this process, I actually asked the CIA to analyze examples of America financing and supplying arms to an insurgency in a country that actually worked out well. And they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with much,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> he said. </p><p> In the summer of 2012, the administration rejected a plan to arm and train rebel fighters in Jordan. The plan, developed by then-director of the CIA David Petraeus, was eventually reworked. Once it was alleged that President Assad\xe2\x80\x99s forces had used chemical weapons against opposition fighters and civilians, Obama signed a secret order allowing the CIA to train and arm rebels in the conflict. </p><p> </p><p> To this day, the Obama administration has declared rebels they have assisted are so-called <em>\xe2\x80\x9cmoderates\xe2\x80\x9d</em> among such Islamist, Al-Qaeda-associated groups as Nusra Front and the group now known as Islamic State. The latter is the current target of <a href="http://rt.com/usa/195060-intelligence-air-strike-failures/" target="_blank">US-led airstrikes</a> in Iraq and Syria to counter the group\xe2\x80\x99s spreading influence in the region. </p><p> As the focus of its ire recently shifted from Assad\xe2\x80\x99s Syrian forces to Islamic State, the Obama administration authorized the Pentagon to begin training as many as 5,000 <em>\xe2\x80\x9cvetted\xe2\x80\x9d</em> rebels per year in Saudi Arabia. The program, though, needs more thorough planning before it begins, the US Department of Defense\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman said last week. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is going to be a long-term effort,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> said Rear Adm. John Kirby. </p><p> The CIA\xe2\x80\x99s review, according to former American officials familiar with its contents, found that the agency has a dismal record when it comes to boosting insurgencies without ground assistance, as is the case right now in the fight against Islamic State. Those efforts include instances like the Bay of Pigs, where the CIA chose to fight proxy wars against the Soviet Union, or to combat Leftists governments, such as the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. </p><p> </p><p> The only instance the review found where an insurgency was successfully armed and trained by the CIA without the help of American ground forces was in Afghanistan in the 1980s, when mujahedeen fighters were assisted against occupying Soviet forces. The covert war there led to the eventual military withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989. The CIA review also found that the mujahedeen effort received a boost from Pakistani intelligence officers working on the ground with rebels. </p><p> Yet looking back, aiding mujahedeen fighters was not a clear-cut victory for the US, as their defeat of Soviet forces eventually led to the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan, which gave sanctuary to Al-Qaeda in the run-up to their attacks on US territories on Sept. 11, 2001. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat came afterwards was impossible to eliminate from anyone\xe2\x80\x99s imagination,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> said a former senior official about the early debates among Obama administration officials surrounding the arming of Syrian rebels. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/usa/196276-lockheed-nuclear-fusion-reactor/</guid><title><![CDATA[Lockheed announces major breakthrough in nuclear fusion]]></title><link>http://rt.com/usa/196276-lockheed-nuclear-fusion-reactor/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/eb/40/00/52.jpg" title="Screenshot from YouTube user LockheedMartinVideos"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 17:42:13 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://img.rt.com/files/news/2f/eb/40/00/52.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The largest military contractor in the United States is developing a nuclear fusion reactor that is small enough to fit on the back of a truck but has the ability to produce the energy required to power a warship.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/eb/40/00/52.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Screenshot from YouTube user LockheedMartinVideos" /> <p> Lockheed Martin said in a statement released on Wednesday this week that its secretive Skunk Works division \xe2\x80\x94 the unit responsible for the U-2 spy plane and F-117 stealth jet \xe2\x80\x94 has already applied for several patents related to the high-tech reactor it has in the works, and expects it to be deployed during the next decade if interested industry and government partners sign on to help starting soon. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cOur compact fusion concept combines several alternative magnetic confinement approaches, taking the best parts of each, and offers a 90 percent size reduction over previous concepts,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Tom McGuire, the compact fusion lead for the Skunk Works\xe2\x80\x99 Revolutionary Technology Programs, said in a statement. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe smaller size will allow us to design, build and test the CFR in less than a year.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UlYClniDFkM?feature=player_embedded" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" width="640"></iframe> </p><p> According to an article published by <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/15/us-lockheed-fusion-idUSKCN0I41EM20141015" target="_blank">Reuters</a> on Wednesday, McGuire told reporters that Skunk Works has already successfully shown the company can build a 100-megawatt reactor that measures seven by 10 feet, or around 10 times smaller than what is currently available.

He accidentally struck upon the burial site while excavating the remains of the much older Thracian city of Perperikon, not far from Bulgaria\xe2\x80\x99s border with Greece. </p><p> <br> Ovcharov said the 2lb (1kg) iron rod had been hammered into the chest of the man \xe2\x80\x93 thought to have been between 40 and 50 at the time of death \xe2\x80\x93 and a part of the left leg below the knee was separately placed next to the rest of the skeleton. It is presumed that the leg may have been sawn off, to stop the vampire from \'escaping\xe2\x80\x99 the grave. <br><br><em>"Often these rituals were applied to people who had died in unusual circumstances, such as suicide,"</em> said Ovcharov. <br><br> While the find appears unusual, Bozhidar Dimitrov, head of the National History Museum in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, said that at least 100 such corpses have been discovered by archaeologists within the country\xe2\x80\x99s borders. </p><p> <br> The media paid particular attention to the \xe2\x80\x98Twin Vampires of Sozopol\xe2\x80\x99, two corpses discovered in 2012 and 2013, also bearing evidence of gruesome burial rituals. </p><p> In the earlier find, the feet of the man had been tied together, to complement the plowshare. In the second one, where an unusually tall 5\xe2\x80\x9911\xe2\x80\x9d (180cm) skeleton was found \xe2\x80\x93 supposedly belonging to a notorious 13th-century pirate by the name of Krivich \xe2\x80\x93 a specially-processed stone had been laid across his chest. The diggers have said that sometimes a cat or a chicken was also buried next to the dead bodies, to \'watch over\' the vampire. <br><br> Ovcharov has played a key role in many of the finds in the past three decades. With his media-friendly persona, and his penchant for sand-colored fedoras, the scientist, himself the son of a renowned archaeologist, has earned routine comparisons to Indiana Jones. <br><br><span style="background-color: initial;">Unfortunately, archeological digs are plagued by illegal intruders in Bulgaria</span><span style="background-color: initial;">. It is estimated that 300 gangs of undercover tomb raiders operate in the country, making at least 30 million euro a year collectively, according to Dimitrov. These unlicensed groups, which often wreck precious historical sites, digging carelessly under the cover of night, extract precious artifacts \xe2\x80\x93 including Roman coins, and Thracian armor \xe2\x80\x93 before exporting them under false documents to be sold in auctions elsewhere, or directly to rich Middle Eastern collectors.</span> </p><p> <br> Ovacharov has made it his life\xe2\x80\x99s work to protect and reconstruct the site of Perperikon, the site of many of the vampire finds. A center of civilization as long as 5,000 years ago, it is thought to have been the host to wild, orgiastic ceremonies praising the god Dionysus, as well as being the birthplace of legendary poet Orpheus. Later it became home to a massive Roman palace and after that Byzantine basilicas. <br><br><em>\xe2\x80\x9cIt rivals Machu Picchu. Bulgarian archaeology has enormous potential. It can change the way people think about this country. It can give us national pride as well as bringing in a lot of wealth,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> said Ovcharov in an interview with the Independent last year, outlining his vision that would see illegal diggers replaced with millions of tourists, currently unaware of Bulgaria\xe2\x80\x99s complex history, on the edge of the Oriental and Western civilizations. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/uk/196244-uk-police-taser-rise/</guid><title><![CDATA[Shocking: Huge rise in UK police use of Tasers]]></title><link>http://rt.com/uk/196244-uk-police-taser-rise/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/e9/40/00/35.jpg" title="British police officer holding a taser.(AFP Photo / Carl De Souza)"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 17:03:38 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/e9/40/00/35.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The use of Tasers by British police has continued to skyrocket, according to new figures published by the Home Office on Wednesday.

That is compared with the many months of firearm training officers get before being allowed to carry a gun. </p><p> While the figures from the Home Office show the frequency of Taser use by British authorities, they do not indicate when or why the measures were used. </p><p> Commenting on the Home Office figures, Amnesty International expressed concerns that some police forces seemed more willing than others to use the weapons. The charity cited data which showed West Midlands police discharged the weapon more frequently than the London Metropolitan Police, despite being a smaller unit. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s also a real concern that some police officers \xe2\x80\x93 those from Greater Manchester Police for example \xe2\x80\x93 are using the Tasers in the controversial \xe2\x80\x98drive-stun\' mode where the weapon is used like an electric cattle prod, causing extreme pain,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> said Amnesty International UK\xe2\x80\x99s Arms Control Director Oliver Sprague. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cWhile the police always insist that their officers are using Tasers responsibly and on a relatively small number of occasions, the Home Office figures show that Taser use has actually quadrupled in the past five years.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Campaigners say the weapon, particularly those that can fire a 50,000 volt charge, can result in mental as well as physical damage. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIn particular, we act for those who have mental health problems or learning difficulties and where police officers failed to consider whether a Taser was justified in light of the individuals\xe2\x80\x99 particular needs. The inappropriate use of a Taser can result in long-term psychological damage,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Irwin Mitchell solicitors\xe2\x80\x99 Nancy Mullins told The Telegraph. </p><p> </p><p> Tasers were introduced into UK police forces in 2004, to give officers an alternative to using firearms or heavy weapons such as batons. However, many activists and campaigners have warned that the police were misusing their powers. </p><p> Last year, a senior police spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers (APCO), Simon Chesterman, said the rise in the use of Tasers was the direct result of it being allowed for everyday police use back in 2008. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThese figures show the use of Taser has increased in line with the rollout of more weapons. There will be concerns raised by individuals that don\'t necessarily understand the underlying causes of the increase and there will be people raising concerns over this who don\'t agree with the police having Taser,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> he said. </p><p> The weapon works by firing a high voltage electric charge via two thin metal strips, which causes the victim\xe2\x80\x99s muscles to shake \xe2\x80\x98uncontrollably.\xe2\x80\x99 </p><p> Around 12 percent of UK police officers carry a Taser and under official government guidelines, all officers must be trained before being allowed to use one. </p><p> Earlier this year, Devon and Cornwall police were slammed for deploying Tasers on two boys aged 14 and 15, after reports of an alleged assault on a teacher at Chelfham Senior School </p><p> Similarly in March, an elderly Lancashire man was shot with a Taser after police officers mistook his walking stick for a samurai sword. </p><p> However, the police have defended Tasers as a necessary policing tool, maintaining that police forces adequately train officers in the proper use of the equipment. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cTaser is not a panacea to all occasions when police officers need to use force and will only be used in situations where officers face violence or the threat of violence,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> said a Taser spokesperson for the Association of Chief Police Officers, Commander Neil Basu. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe home secretary gave additional funding to support an extension to the roll-out of Taser just over five years ago, which resulted in the procurement of around 5,500 more Tasers for distribution to forces.</em> </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe increases in device numbers and officer training is [sic] the core factor in the increases which we have seen in today\xe2\x80\x99s figures.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Commander Basu also said that the figures only displayed the \xe2\x80\x98use\xe2\x80\x99 of Tasers, rather than the firing of electric shocks, meaning that most police only fired an infra-red laser from the weapon to be used as a warning signal. </p><p> Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) data, published in July, found Taser use was the highest in Staffordshire, with shots being fired 33 times per hundred officers. In contrast, the city of London had one of the lowest rates of Taser usage. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/uk/196260-bbc-iphone-staff-training/</guid><title><![CDATA[BBC spends more than \xc2\xa3200,000 on staff iPhone training]]></title><link>http://rt.com/uk/196260-bbc-iphone-staff-training/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/ea/40/00/53.jpg" title="Reuters / Yuya Shino "/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 16:56:52 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/ea/40/00/53.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The BBC has reportedly spent 200,000 pounds training its staff to use iPhones, according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act.

In total, the BBC bought 4,266 iPhones, 427 iPads and 815 MacBooks between January 2012 and October 2013.</span> </p><p> In the course of two years, the BBC bought iPhones at a rate of 200 per month. </p><p> The spike in tech spending has provoked anger among TV license fee payers. Viewers pay 145.50 pounds a year for a color TV, which is spent on BBC services and programming. </p><p> Andrew Sylvester, of the Taxpayers Alliance said: <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s absolutely incredible that the BBC has run up a bill of this size teaching staff to use mainstream technology.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> He called the spending unnecessary, adding that <em>\xe2\x80\x9cschool teachers across the country know full well that teenagers can master an iPhone, so professionals should be able to.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> In response to the claims, the BBC revealed that last year\xe2\x80\x99s training bill was 42,000 pounds, which is the lowest ever figure. </p><p> According to the BBC\xe2\x80\x99s 2013 Annual Report, the entire training cost of 42,000 pounds accounted for less than 0.5 percent of its total operating budget. </p><p> Mark Wray, Head of the BBC\xe2\x80\x99s College of Journalism, refuted claims that the spending was <em>\xe2\x80\x9cincredible.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> He states that the world is undergoing a <em>\xe2\x80\x9crevolution in newsgathering\xe2\x80\x9d</em> whereby the use of smartphone technology is providing unprecedented access to breaking news. </p><p> He further claims that by spending money on training journalists to maximize the use of their smartphones, they will reduce the cost of journalism in the long run. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fair and appropriate to ask whether the sizeable sums quoted are providing value for money,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> said Wray. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cSadly that\xe2\x80\x99s the part of the story some of our critics don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear.

An outbreak of the often-deadly disease has only worsened during those three-and-a-half months, however, and no fewer than three Americans are currently being treated for the virus after it first surfaced in the US in late September. </p><p> Corgenix researchers say the test they\xe2\x80\x99re developing works like a pregnancy test and can quickly identify whether or not a patient has contracted Ebola using a blood sample in only 15 minutes. Optimistically, the product may be able to save thousands, perhaps millions of lives if the current outbreak worsens and cases continue to be spotted in the US. According to a report published earlier this month by the <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/15/texas-college-s-ebola-racism-reaches-a-new-low.html" target="_blank">Daily Beast</a>, however, researchers are \xe2\x80\x9c<em>at a standstill</em>\xe2\x80\x9d until their certain the tests are 100 percent accurate. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have to prove that it works,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Dr. Bob Garry, a scientist at Tulane University working with Corgenix on the tests, told the Beast. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe timing is what\xe2\x80\x99s holding us up.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Nevertheless, some involved in the research say that health officials needn\xe2\x80\x99t 100 percent certainty when evaluating possible Ebola patients and should begin embracing the rapid tests regardless. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have a positive, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s a false positive, you\xe2\x80\x99re erring on the side of caution. That is good,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Dr. Alan Wu, a chemistry lab director at San Francisco General and professor at lab medicine at University of California-SF, told the Beast. </p><p> <em>"Not having to wait would help internationally slow and quell this outbreak exponentially,"</em> Dr. Frank Welch, the medical director for community preparedness at the Louisiana Office of Public Health, added to the <a href="http://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/2014/10/tulane_researchers_race_to_dev.html" target="_blank">Mississippi Press</a> this week. <em>"There is no bad news with having this test."</em> </p><p> Currently, only a handful of medical facilities in the US have the capability to test for Ebola, and the absence of widespread standards in the midst of the record-breaking outbreak has not gone without comment: the executive director of National Nurses United wrote in the Washington Post recently that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Only greater integration and the authority of a public health system with national, uniform standards can protect Americans</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d and Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Tuesday this week that the CDC is developing response teams that could be deployed \xe2\x80\x9c<em>on the ground within hours</em>\xe2\x80\x9d should further Ebola cases be confirmed in the US. </p><p> It takes upwards of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/qa.html" target="_blank">three weeks</a> for infected patients to begin showing signs of Ebola, the CDC says, and the infrastructure in place in the US for conducting tests once symptoms appear may take days since, currently, blood samples can only be properly analyzed at select American facilities. Frieden\xe2\x80\x99s plan to assemble rapid response teams aims to change that. </p><p> Already, though, American Ebola victims are growing in numbers. On Wednesday, officials in Dallas, Texas confirmed that a second health worker has contracted the deadly virus and was hospitalized within 90 minutes of complaining of symptoms. Nina Pham, a Dallas nurse, is currently being treated for the virus in an area hospital after she was diagnosed with the disease last week; Pham is believed to have contracted the disease from Thomas Eric Duncan, a 42-year-old Liberian national who died in the US last Wednesday after being treated in Dallas. Separately, an American photographer for NBC News is being treated in Nebraska for Ebola currently after catching the disease while on assignment last month in West Africa. </p><p> Boisen of Colorado\xe2\x80\x99s Corginex said that his team\xe2\x80\x99s product in-progress can confirm the presence of Ebola in only 15 minutes, and is already being used to detect Lassa, a similar virus, spreading in West Africa. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIt can be done in the field in a difficult environment like West Africa, Central Africa and results are available very quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> company CEO Douglass Simpson told CBS 4. </p><p> As fears worsen of a domestic epidemic in America, however, Corgenix officials says regulators in the US won\xe2\x80\x99t be ready anytime soon to approve the product for use in the States. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if the CDC said we need to speed this process up. Could you do that? We\xe2\x80\x99re in sixth gear now. We\xe2\x80\x99re going as fast as we possibly can,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Simpson said. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is safe to say Colorado is on the cutting edge of technology in detecting Ebola?

According to a new study, humans living on the Red Planet would begin dying off within 68 days of landing on the fourth rock from the sun.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/e5/80/00/1.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / HO" /> <p> The Mars One plan to send humans to Mars by 2025 has certainly captured a lot of imaginations. After the application deadline came and passed earlier this month, more than 200,000 people from 140 countries had applied to make mankind\xe2\x80\x99s maiden voyage to the Red Planet. </p><p> According to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, there is one problem: if they did make the trip, they would all die off within a couple months. </p><p> Drawing on data from the Mars One group, the team used computer modeling to determine the required amounts of oxygen, food and technology needed for the project. </p><p> According to their <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/90819#files-area" target="_blank">35-page report</a>, the problem, ironically, is not too little oxygen, but rather, too much of it. So far, Mars One plans to grow its crops in the same space where people live. According to the data, the first wheat crop would reach maturity at around 68 days, causing a spike in oxygen. </p><p> The problem is, all of that oxygen is highly flammable and will need to be vented out. Existing technology, however, does not allow for vents to distinguish nitrogen from oxygen, so as the oxygen is sucked out, so goes the nitrogen. </p><p> That would leave the colonizers with two choices: die due to suffocation from low air pressure or watch your entire Martian colony erupt in a ball of fire. If that\xe2\x80\x99s not enough, the colonists would be living in sweltering 100 degree humidity while the wheat reached maturity. The students also found that the Dutch-based Mars One group had drastically underestimated the cost of spare parts, logistics and maintenance required to keep the station up and running. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe continued operation of the ISS [International Space Station] is dependent upon regular (and even unplanned) resupply of replacement parts from Earth, and in the event of an unrecoverable system failure the crew have the option to quickly return to Earth. On Mars, resupply logistics will be much more challenging and there will be no feasible option for the crew to return to Earth in a timely manner,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> the report read. </p><p> It added that the ability to repair and sustain systems on the planet, as well as having access to the parts necessary to do this, <em>\xe2\x80\x9cis critical to mission safety.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> The team said that after 130 months on the Martian surface, spare parts would begin to take up 62 percent of the mass transported there. It added that in the most optimistic scenario, <em>\xe2\x80\x9cthe first crew of a Mars settlement will require approximately 15 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy" target="_blank">Falcon Heavy</a> launches costing $4.5 billion, and these values will grow with additional crews.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Psychological strain, limited diet, constrained living space and repetitive social interactions are also noted as potential problems. </p><p> </p><p> The longest any human being has ever stayed in space was 437 days. The cosmonaut to achieve the feat was Valery Polyakov, who spent his time aboard the Mir space station nearly two decades back. </p><p> Polyakov spoke at the time of having a rough time adjusting to conditions on the station, though mentally he rebounded within three weeks\xe2\x80\x99 time. </p><p> A doctor by trade, Polyakov volunteered for the mission to prove the human body could survive the strains of microgravity for a long enough period to survive the journey to Mars. </p><p> As it stands, Polyakov\xe2\x80\x99s record will unlikely be broken until humans venture to the Red Planet. </p><p> In line with its tentative schedule, Mars One plans to send their first crew of four astronauts to Mars in 2025 following a seven-month voyage from Earth. Additional teams would be sent every other year, with the hope that by 2033, more than 20 people will be living on the planet. Mars One intends to send a communication station, habitat modules and a rover to the planet before humans make their grand appearance. </p><p> For those who boldly go where no man has gone before, one thing remains certain: whether they live 68 days or 68 years, Mars One has stressed to its potential astronauts that there\xe2\x80\x99s no going back. </p><p> But for the pioneers willing to take the trip, that small sacrifice will be worth the next great leap they hope to make for mankind. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/196236-ukraine-russia-meeting-putin/</guid><title><![CDATA[\xe2\x80\x98High expectations\xe2\x80\x99: Putin, Poroshenko to talk gas, Ukraine crisis in Italy]]></title><link>http://rt.com/news/196236-ukraine-russia-meeting-putin/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/e8/c0/00/25.jpg" title="Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) shakes hands with his Ukrainian counterpart Petro Poroshenko, as Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev (C) stands nearby, in Minsk August 26, 2014.(Reuters / Sergei Bondarenko)"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 15:54:25 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/e8/c0/00/25.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The presidents of Russia and Ukraine are to meet at a business breakfast in Milan on Friday, with the fragile peace in Ukraine and gas supplies to Europe expected to dominate.

But he did not rule out that leaders of the two countries will agree on it at a meeting in a larger format, Ushakov said. </p><p> For the European side negotiations in Milan are also an encouraging sign as natural gas supplies to Europe will be on the agenda. A long-running dispute over gas sales is one of the main concerns for the European states, which are potentially facing energy shortage as cold winter is approaching. </p><p> It now depends on supplies agreement between Russia and Ukraine. About 15 percent of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s total energy supply runs from Russia through Ukraine. In June, Gazprom shut off supplies to Ukraine, but continue to deliver to European neighbors. </p><p> On September 26, Russia, Ukraine and the EU held three-way gas negotiations in Berlin, where a so-called \xe2\x80\x9cwinter plan\xe2\x80\x9d was discussed. According to it Ukraine will pay Gazprom $2 billion as part of its gas debt by the end of October and an additional $1.1 billion in advance payment by year\xe2\x80\x99s end for 5 billion cubic meters of gas, the EU Energy Commissioner Gunther Oettinger said. </p><p> However, no final documents have been sealed, as price and payment schedule remain the stumbling blocks in the negotiations. </p><p> </p><p> Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak and Gazprom CEO Aleksey Miller are also expected to discuss Russian gas deliveries to Europe via Ukraine, Ushakov said. </p><p> <em>"Miller and Novak will be present in Milan, because it is possible that talks on the gas issue will be held during the [Asia-Europe Meeting] summit\xe2\x80\xa6 European Commission officials in charge of this issue are also expected to attend,"</em> </p><p> Putin might also meet with German and French leaders as well as Ukrainian leadership in the so-called \xe2\x80\x98Normandy format\xe2\x80\x99. </p><p> The first such meeting was held in Normandy this June during the 70th anniversary of the D-Day invasion. </p><p> The US sees the ASEM as a possibility for reaching next steps of the reconciliation of the internal conflict in Ukraine. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThere is an agreement reached in addition to the Minsk Agreement itself through further discussions between President Poroshenko and President Putin where they\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed on some timelines on some of these things,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> US Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday after talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cSo we\xe2\x80\x99ll wait to hear from that meeting and the results of that meeting sort of where things stand at that point in time,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> he added. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/uk/196228-hong-kong-cameron-protests/</guid><title><![CDATA[Cameron backs Hong Kong rights, China blocks BBC site]]></title><link>http://rt.com/uk/196228-hong-kong-cameron-protests/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/e8/40/00/14.jpg" title="British Prime Minister David Cameron.(Reuters / Omar Sobhani)"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 15:53:46 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/e8/40/00/14.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Prime Minister David Cameron said on Wednesday Britain should stand up for the rights of the people of Hong Kong after more than two weeks of pro-democracy protests in the former British colony.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/e8/40/00/14.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="British Prime Minister David Cameron.(Reuters / Omar Sobhani)" /> <p> <span style="background-color: initial;">Asked about the protests during Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Prime Minister Questions, Cameron said, <em>\xe2\x80\x9cit is important that democracy involves real choices.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> The comments come as Hong Kong\xe2\x80\x99s citizens take to the streets to protest against Chinese restrictions on the 2017 election of the next chief executive.</span> </p><p> The agreement brokered when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 included guarantees on <em>\xe2\x80\x9crights and freedoms, including those of person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, and, indeed, of strike,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Cameron said. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThese are important freedoms, jointly guaranteed through that joint declaration and it\xe2\x80\x99s that which, most of all, we should stand up for,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> he added. </p><p> Protests have since escalated in the semi-autonomous region.

Paterson believes this cannot be achieved without significant investment. He will urge the UK government to abandon the plan. </p><p> The Conservative MP, who was replaced as Environment Secretary by Liz Truss in the July Cabinet reshuffle, questions the scientific evidence surrounding climate change and describes the levels of warming linked to carbon dioxide as <em>\xe2\x80\x9cuncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> This latest speech makes him the most senior politician to openly criticize the government\xe2\x80\x99s economic policies. </p><p> Over the past 35 years, the climate has changed <em>\xe2\x80\x9cnothing like as fast\xe2\x80\x9d</em> as it was predicted, Patterson will say, claiming the current government strategy will see the lights go out <em>\xe2\x80\x9cwithin a generation.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Some of the claims laid out in his speech, however, have been refuted by Richard Black, the Director of ECIU (Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit). </p><p> </p><p> However, Black claims there is narrowing headroom between peak demand and peak supply, <em>\xe2\x80\x9cnone of the major players in the field \xe2\x80\x93 DECC, the National Grid, Ofgem \xe2\x80\x93 believe the lights are about to go out.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Black further states ministers would be unable to simply suspend work on the current climate goals. He claims there is no simple get-out clause. </p><p> The only way in which ministers could amend the emission reduction target is if <em>\xe2\x80\x9cthere have been significant developments in scientific knowledge about climate change, or European or international law or policy, that make it appropriate to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time Paterson has courted controversy. Previous policies as Environment Secretary earned him a reputation as a <em>\xe2\x80\x9cpro-hunting, pro-badger cull, anti-wind, pro-fracking\xe2\x80\x9d</em> minister, who remained a staunch climate skeptic. </p><p> His removal from office was gladly received by Friends of the Earth, who called him <em>\xe2\x80\x9cthe worst Environment Secretary the UK has had in decades.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Whilst the Conservative Party have been known to host climate skeptics, such as Nigel Lawson and Peter Lilley, the speech from Paterson goes against the climate plans laid out by Prime Minister David Cameron during the UN Climate Summit in September. </p><p> Cameron announced that <em>\xe2\x80\x9cclimate change is one of the most serious threats facing our world.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> He added that <em>\xe2\x80\x9cit is not just a threat to the environment.

The hospital had withheld her name, age, and position until the family offered further details. </p><p> She did not exhibit symptoms of Ebola during the flight, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). </p><p> Vinson said she got a green light from the CDC before boarding the flight, <a href="http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/10/15/ebola-patient-traveled-day-before-diagnosis/" target="_blank">CBS Dallas Fort Worth</a> reported. The nurse said she was in contact with the CDC on multiple occasions to make sure it was permissible for her to fly with her fever. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThis nurse, Nurse Vinson, did in fact call the CDC several times before taking that flight and said she has a temperature, a fever of 99.5, and the person at the CDC looked at a chart and because her temperature wasn\xe2\x80\x99t 100.4 or higher she didn\xe2\x80\x99t officially fall into the category of high risk,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> CBS Dallas medical reporter Dr. John LaPook said. </p><p> The CDC also confirmed to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/heatherhaysfox4/posts/777826592278522" target="_blank">Fox 4 News</a> that it told Vinson she could fly. </p><p> Nevertheless, during a Wednesday news conference, CDC Director Thomas Frieden said the nurse should not have traveled on a commercial airline, and in the future healthcare workers in contact with Ebola patients should be prevented from doing so. At the same time, Frieden confirmed that there is very low risk to any passenger who shared the flight with her. </p><p> The CDC has urged other passengers on Vinson\xe2\x80\x99s Ohio-to-Texas flight to call its toll-free hotline, 1-800-CDC-INFO. </p><p> Vinson was part of the team of dozens who treated Duncan earlier this month. Duncan, who had traveled to Dallas from his native Liberia, died on Oct. 8 from effects of Ebola, the <a href="http://rt.com/trends/ebola-outbreak/">latest outbreak</a> of which has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa. Nurse Nina Pham, also on the team that treated Duncan, was confirmed on Sunday to have contracted Ebola. She was in good condition, doctors said, as of late Tuesday. </p><p> Dr. Daniel Varga, the hospital\xe2\x80\x99s clinical director, described the diagnosis of Vinson, whom he did not name, as <em>\xe2\x80\x9can unprecedented crisis\xe2\x80\x9d</em> at a news conference on Wednesday, adding that it is yet unknown how she was infected, but that <em>\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s clear there was an exposure somewhere, sometime in their treatment of Mr. Duncan,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> he said, <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/ebola-diagnosed-in-second-dallas-nurse-105542930.html" target="_blank">according</a> to Yahoo News. </p><p> </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re a hospital that may have done some things different with the benefit of what we know today,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Varga said. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cMake no mistake, no one wants to get this right more than our hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said during the news conference that the new diagnosis was a <em>\xe2\x80\x9cgut shot\xe2\x80\x9d</em> to hospital staff, adding that local officials are taking into account the possibility of more workers who treated Duncan testing positive in the coming days. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a very real possibility,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> he said. </p><p> The CDC said Tuesday that 76 people at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital could have had exposure to Duncan following his second visit to the emergency room on Sept. 28. He initially sought care at the hospital on Sept. 25, but was sent home the next morning. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cAs we have said before, because of our ongoing investigation, it is not unexpected that there would be additional exposures,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> the CDC said in a statement early Wednesday. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cAn additional health care worker testing positive for Ebola is a serious concern, and the CDC has already taken active steps to minimize the risk to health care workers and the patient.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Another 48 people identified as having contact with Duncan before he was isolated on Sept. 28 have not shown signs of Ebola. </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/usa/195880-ebola-patient-tweet-recovery/" target="_blank">Nurse Pham</a>, the first American Ebola patient diagnosed in the US, had contact with Duncan the first nine of ten days he was in isolation care at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, according to medical records obtained by AP. After running a fever on Friday, Oct. 10, she went to the hospital where she was placed in an isolation unit. </p><h2> Nurses allege poor standards </h2><p> Ebola is transferred via contact with bodily fluids from a disease carrier. Pham had worn protective gear - a gown, mask, gloves, and a face shield - while treating Duncan, hospital officials said early this week, according to Dallas Morning News. </p><p> Yet late Tuesday, the largest nurses\xe2\x80\x99 union in the United States pushed back against the narrative that health care workers at the scrutinized hospital were required to take proper precautions from the beginning of Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s care there. </p><p> Nurses at the hospital told National Nurses United that workers were left exposed due to lack of protective gear and constantly-shifting safety standards, AP reported. The nurses that spoke out were in a position to know about Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s care and protocol offered to staff regarding how to deal with Ebola, Nurses United said. </p><p> In a statement, RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of Nurses United, said <em>\xe2\x80\x9cseveral\xe2\x80\x9d</em> and <em>\xe2\x80\x9ca few\xe2\x80\x9d</em> nurses - she did not specify how many - alleged that: Duncan was held in a non-isolated area of the emergency room for hours, possibly infecting many others; patients exposed to Duncan were only isolated for one day before being released to areas with other patients; Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s nurses were treating other patients; Ebola training for staff was not mandatory, nor was it prioritized; Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s lab samples went through the hospital\xe2\x80\x99s pneumatic tubes, possibly contaminating the specimen delivery system; and hazardous waste was not disposed of properly. </p><p> <em>"There was no advance preparedness on what to do with the patient, there was no protocol, there was no system,"</em> said Deborah Burger of Nurses United, according to AP. </p><p> </p><p> Burger said even now, some workers at the hospital still do not have proper Ebola-safe equipment. </p><p> <em>"Hospital managers have assured nurses that proper equipment has been ordered but it has not arrived yet,"</em> she said. </p><p> Nurses had to <em>"interact with Mr. Duncan with whatever protective equipment was available"</em> despite the presence of <em>"a lot of contagious fluids,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> according to the union\xe2\x80\x99s statement. </p><p> The hospital\xe2\x80\x99s nurses are not represented by Nurses United, or any other union. DeMoro and Burger said that nurses indicated they were told by the hospital not to talk to the press for risk of losing their job. </p><p> Wendell Watson, a spokesman for the Dallas hospital, did not respond to specific claims made by the nurses and said that this is the first time the hospital has heard such allegations. </p><p> <em>"Patient and employee safety is our greatest priority and we take compliance very seriously,"</em> he said in a statement. <em>"We have numerous measures in place to provide a safe working environment, including mandatory annual training and a 24/7 hotline and other mechanisms that allow for anonymous reporting."</em> </p><p> He added that the hospital would <em>"review and respond to any concerns raised by our nurses and all employees."</em> </p><p> David R. Wright, deputy regional administrator for the US Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for oversight of patient safety, indicated interest in the nurses accusations. </p><p> <em>"We can\'t talk about whether we\'re going to investigate or not, but we\'d be interested in hearing that information,"</em> he said, according to AP. </p><p> The CDC has yet to respond to the allegations. </p><p> Vinson\xe2\x80\x99s infection was confirmed through testing done at a state laboratory in Austin, and the CDC is conducting a second test expected to conclude sometime Wednesday. </p><p> Her Dallas apartment, where she lived alone with no pets, is being decontaminated by specialists, Yahoo News reported. </p><p> </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/business/196208-sanctions-against-medvedev-cnbc-interview/</guid><title><![CDATA[US, EU businesses oppose Russia sanctions but can\'t say it- Medvedev]]></title><link>http://rt.com/business/196208-sanctions-against-medvedev-cnbc-interview/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/e7/00/00/10.jpg" title="Russia\'s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev (L) speaks with CNBC journalist Geoff Cutmore during an interview in Moscow, October 14, 2014.(Reuters / Yekaterina Shtukina)"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 15:38:33 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/e7/00/00/10.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />European and US businesses are \xe2\x80\x9ccategorically\xe2\x80\x9d against Russian sanctions because they act against their commercial interests, but can\xe2\x80\x99t say so freely, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has said.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/e7/00/00/10.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Russia\'s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev (L) speaks with CNBC journalist Geoff Cutmore during an interview in Moscow, October 14, 2014.(Reuters / Yekaterina Shtukina)" /> <p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m absolutely certain that European businesses are categorically against this because it\xe2\x80\x99s contrary to their interests,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> the Prime Minister said in an <a href="http://government.ru/en/news/15235/" target="_blank">interview</a> with CNBC aired Wednesday. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve also talked with US business representatives.

The economic sanctions lasted more than 50 years and restricted exports to the Soviet Union. </p><p> </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cBut the country continued developing nonetheless,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Medvedev said and added, <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThere were attempts to introduce sanctions in the 1990s but with zero result.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Throughout the Cold War era the US imposed sanctions and embargoes against China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Iran. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cHave sanctions on Iran produced any result?

The US wants its aircrafts which are returning from high Ebola-risk countries such as Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia to be able to stop over. <br><br> Spanish military health officials are negotiating <em>\xe2\x80\x9cstrict protocols\xe2\x80\x9d</em> with the Pentagon, reported El Pais on Wednesday. The virus has already killed 4,447 people worldwide, with the majority of the deaths occurring in Liberia. <br><br> There have been 8,914 cases overall, and the WHO has stated that it expects the number to pass 9,000 by the end of the week and could soon reach 10,000. <br><br> While assurances have been given that the usage of the bases will not in any way contribute to the spread of the disease, according to El Pais sources, Spain remains apprehensive about the possibility of more cases on its territory. <br><br> A Spanish nurse who had been treating a missionary who returned from West Africa in September was found to have contracted the disease at the beginning of October. <br><br> While she is currently in a stable condition, some 100 people who passed into contact with her are being subjected to monitoring over fears that she may have infected others around her while she was still a contamination risk. </p><p> <br> Washington has subsequently issued guarantees that no medical personnel who have come into direct contact with Ebola patients will be traveling on the planes which pass through the air bases. Anyone who is suspected to pose a contamination risk will be banned. <br><br> Stopovers will be used primarily for refueling and staff travelling on the planes will not leave the bases <br><br> A further 100 US troops were reported to have arrived in Liberia to help fight the Ebola epidemic, reported NBC on Tuesday.

Across the busy road, a young, innocent-looking Ukrainian army officer, in uniform, walked a Labrador retriever. It wasn\'t golden. It was black. </p><p> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>That\'s a very dark-colored Labrador</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the Brit. </p><p> The American took a puff of his cigarette and nodded his head, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Is it chocolate?</em>\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>No, I\'d say it\'s a kind of \'night\' color, the color of the \'night\', yes that\'s what is</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d reasoned the Englishman in disagreement. </p><p> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Could you say \'inky\'?</em>\xe2\x80\x9d the American quizzed. </p><p> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>You could indeed. Jolly good. \'Inky\' it is</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the Englishman. </p><p> The two men, delighted by their agility in finding ways to define the dog in every way except the correct form, had a joint chuckle. They were getting good at this. Almost a year ensconced in Kiev, finding myriad terms to soft-soap the most unspeakable acts had served them well. Over cheap, watery Ukrainian pilsners they would frequently guffaw about how their work had helped the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>revolution</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p> As the latest crowd of nubile local young things gathered at their table, they\'d show examples of how friendly they were to Ukraine. It was all online, in black and white. Life was good. A Western income stretched far in an impoverished land. </p><p> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>What about the young soldier?</em>\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Brit. </p><p> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Definitely not a Nazi</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d the American answered. </p><p> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>The yellow and black symbol on his arm. Was that a Wolfsangel?</em>\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p> \xe2\x80\x9c<em>No, no. It was the symbol of the Azov Battalion</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p> They smiled. This routine was well practiced. Yet, just as the smirking began, the American\'s phone rang. There was trouble outside the parliament. </p><p> The first part of the above is my imagination, but I wouldn\'t include it if there wasn\'t a large grain of truth. The last sentence happened yesterday in Kiev. </p><p> Yes, 15 policemen were injured in Kiev and over 50 demonstrators were arrested in <a href="http://rt.com/news/195796-nationalists-protest-kiev-ukraine/" target="_blank">violent clashes</a>. Euromaidan PR and employees of President Porshenko\'s TV channel made the ridiculous accusation that the protestors were pro-Russian. Pro-Russian\'s with Swastika\'s, making Nazi salutes. Yes, they really alleged it. Yes, their mendacity is really that shocking. </p><p> What actually occurred is that the extremists were annoyed because the Rada refused to pass a law recognizing WW2 Nazi collaborators as \xe2\x80\x9cheroes\xe2\x80\x9d of Ukraine. They took to the streets and, when police intervened, all hell broke loose. Not an uncommon sight in Ukraine, this year, sadly. </p><p> The Western media either ignored the story or attempted to airbrush the details. Here is a sample of tweets yesterday. </p><p> Leonid Ragozin \xe2\x80\x93 ex BBC and Newsweek. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> As ever, radical nationalists by the Rada are trying to shift agenda from real stuff - like corruption laws, "incidentally" voted today. </p> <p> \xe2\x80\x94 Leonid Ragozin (@leonidragozin) <a href="https://twitter.com/leonidragozin/status/521968545182547968">October 14, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> Christopher Miller \xe2\x80\x93 Mashable and Kyiv Post </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> Things getting rough on Hrushevskoho Street down the hill from parliament after nationalists try to break into bldg. <a href="http://t.co/6YszrmgDvc">pic.twitter.com/6YszrmgDvc</a> </p> <p> \xe2\x80\x94 Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristopherJM/status/521971206028034050">October 14, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> Maxim Eristavi, co-founder Hromadske TV </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"> <p> This day was too long, too bizarre and too far-right, Kyiv <a href="http://t.co/XEvILxphhK">pic.twitter.com/XEvILxphhK</a> </p> <p> \xe2\x80\x94 Maxim Eristavi (@MaximEristavi) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaximEristavi/status/522122204348030976">October 14, 2014</a> </p> </blockquote><p> So, why is it that Western journalists in Ukraine are unable to call Nazis, \xe2\x80\x9cNazis?\xe2\x80\x9d Instead of using the obvious term, it\'s replaced with \xe2\x80\x9cfar-right\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnationalists.\xe2\x80\x9d Is it because the US government would never support Nazis? Far-right nationalists are more acceptable? Maybe they feel responsible for helping them attain influence and power by \xe2\x80\x93 almost to a man \xe2\x80\x93 supporting the Maidan riots and the subsequent coup? </p><p> Rather than admit to some past mistakes, it appears white-washing is a better policy for the EU and US media. </p><p> The honest thing would be to describe the Ukrainian Insurgent Army for what they were. Funded by Nazi Germany, they mass murdered Jews and Poles. This is continuously sketched over and they are presented as something similar to the Red Army or the Royal Air Force. The same RAF that defeated Germany in the skies and the same Red Army that liberated Europe from fascism. To even infer some level of equality for the UPA with those forces is a hideous thing. However, it\'s happening daily in the Western press. </p><p> The American poet James Whitcomb Riley is thought to have penned: \xe2\x80\x9c<em>When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p> When correspondents in Kiev see Nazis, they report only the presence of far-right nationalists, a far more palatable term. </p><p> Welcome to the bizarre world of Western media in Ukraine. A self-contained pit of rumor, fear, braggadocio and propaganda. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/uk/196172-uk-g7-wealth-inequality/</guid><title><![CDATA[Mind the gap: UK the only G7 state to see a rise in wealth inequality \xe2\x80\x93 report]]></title><link>http://rt.com/uk/196172-uk-g7-wealth-inequality/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/e4/c0/00/48.jpg" title="Reuters / Luke Macgregor"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 14:40:38 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/e4/c0/00/48.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Britain is the only G7 country where inequality has grown since the start of the 21st century, according to a report by Credit Suisse published on Tuesday.

While there were only eight billionaires at the start of the century, the UK now hosts 44. The number of people whose net worth is at least $50m (\xc2\xa331m) has almost quadrupled to 4,660.</span> </p><p> By contrast, all other G7 member states (US, Japan, France, Germany, Canada and Italy) have seen wealth inequality either remain the same or fall since 2000. In the UK, however, with the richest 10 percent in control of 54.1 percent of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s total wealth, the gap continues to widen. </p><p> Recently, the anti-poverty charity Oxfam found Britain\xe2\x80\x99s five richest families are worth more than the country\xe2\x80\x99s poorest 20 percent. </p><p> Oxfam\xe2\x80\x99s head of inequality, Emma Seery, said: <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThese figures give more evidence that inequality is extreme and growing, and that economic recovery following the financial crisis has been skewed in favor of the wealthiest.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Seery claimed that successive British governments have failed to <em>\xe2\x80\x9cget to grips\xe2\x80\x9d</em> with rising inequality. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThose least able to afford it have paid the price of the financial crisis whilst more wealth has flooded into the coffers of the very richest,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> she said. </p><p> <strong>READ MORE:</strong><a href="http://rt.com/business/195816-richest-1-percent-credit-suisse/">Richest 1% own 50 percent of world wealth- Credit Suisse report</a> </p><p> The report shows that wealth inequality is continuing to grow. The richest 1 percent now own 48.2 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s wealth, up from 46 percent last year. Meanwhile the bottom half of the global population own less than 1 percent of the total wealth. </p><p> Anthony Shorrocks, who helped draft the report, told the Guardian that London was a factor in Britain\xe2\x80\x99s rising inequality, because of its rising property prices and its position as Britain\xe2\x80\x99s financial center. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9c[Britain\xe2\x80\x99s rising inequality] could well reflect the regional divide between the South East and the rest of the country,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> he said. </p><p> While the rich are getting richer in Britain, low and middle-income households are struggling due to below inflation wage increases and spiraling rent and utility bills. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>READ MORE:</strong><a href="http://rt.com/usa/sadoff-inequality-rich-poor-685/">Inequality gap between super rich and poor continues to widen</a> </p><p> The report comes as the Campaign to End Child Poverty published a map defining which regions of the UK suffered the highest levels of child poverty. </p><p> Inner-city London scored badly, with 10 out of the top 20 areas suffering the highest child poverty rates, while Glasgow scored as Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s worst-affected area. </p><p> In London, Bethnal Green and Bow had a child poverty rate of 49 percent, compared to affluent Richmond upon Thames, which scored a 15 percent rate. </p><p> The estimates were compiled for the Campaign to End Child Poverty by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. </p><p> Neil Mathers, spokesman for End Child Poverty, said: <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThese figures reveal just how widely and deeply child poverty reaches into our communities.</em> </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cPoliticians of all parties, at Westminster and Holyrood, need to act to tackle the root causes of poverty, including low pay and soaring housing and childcare costs.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Disputing the findings, a government spokesman told the BBC: <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe figures do not provide an accurate picture of child poverty. We\xe2\x80\x99re doing more than ever to help children, the attainment gap for deprived pupils has fallen and we\'ve just seen the largest fall in unemployment since 1988.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Britain\'s unemployment rate fell to 6.0 percent between June and August this year, the lowest level since the three months to October 2008, the ONS revealed on Wednesday. </p><p> While the economy and profits are showing signs of recovery, a majority of Britons are not yet feeling the benefits. </p><p> In a recent YouGov poll, 41 percent of Brits said they were not feeling any benefits from the economic recovery and did not expect to. Just 16 percent said they were already benefiting from an economic recovery when asked in mid-October. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/politics/196212-piutin-approval-grows-poll/</guid><title><![CDATA[Russians\xe2\x80\x99 approval of Putin hits near all-time high, poll shows]]></title><link>http://rt.com/politics/196212-piutin-approval-grows-poll/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/e7/40/00/9.jpg" title="Russia\'s President Vladimir Putin.(AFP Photo / Kirill Kudryavtsev)"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 14:37:28 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/news/2f/e7/40/00/9.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s average approval marks from the Russian public have approached the record level of early 2008, independent research has shown.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/e7/40/00/9.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Russia\'s President Vladimir Putin.(AFP Photo / Kirill Kudryavtsev)" /> <p> The poll conducted in late September by the Levada sociology center shows that the average mark given by Russians to their leader is now 7.33 out of 10. This figure has been higher only once before \xe2\x80\x93 a mark of 7.49 reached in January 2008 at the very end of Putin\xe2\x80\x99s first two terms as president. </p><p> 17 percent of all respondents think Putin deserved the top mark \xe2\x80\x93 10 out of 10 \xe2\x80\x93 for his work. </p><p> In the same poll, 38 percent of Russians said the head of state was worthy of their trust because his current performance was strong and successful. </p><p> At the same time, the overwhelming majority of respondents denied that the president\xe2\x80\x99s popularity was turning into a personality cult. Only 19 percent said they had noticed features resembling a cult, compared to 27 percent a year ago. </p><p> The poll results are consistent with a recent tendency for record-breaking ratings for President Putin and other top Russian officials. Researchers explain this by \xe2\x80\x98mobilization\xe2\x80\x99 and solidarity of society in the face of foreign hostility, and also by events like the accession of the Crimean Republic into the Russian Federation. </p><p> In mid-August, 52 percent of Russians told Levada Center that they were ready to vote for Putin if presidential elections were held on the nearest weekend. January 2014, the share of such people was about 29 percent and that means that Vladimir Putin\xe2\x80\x99s presidential rating has doubled in almost seven months. </p><p> Another influential sociological think-tank, the Public Opinion Foundation, conducted similar research in early August. It found that 68 percent of all potential voters were ready to support Putin at presidential elections, compared to 58 percent in March and 46 percent in January. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/196200-germany-economy-slowdown-euro/</guid><title><![CDATA[\xe2\x80\x98Getting away from sanctions is the only way to stop EU economic downturn\xe2\x80\x99]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/196200-germany-economy-slowdown-euro/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/e6/80/00/7.jpg" title="AFP Photo / Daniel Roland"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 14:23:29 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/e6/80/00/7.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The EU economy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t doing well but sanctions against Russia have worsened it even more, with Germany seeing a decrease in industrial output and exports by 5 percent, which is not a simple downturn but a collapse, economic analyst Michael Mross told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/e6/80/00/7.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / Daniel Roland" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Germany now expects only 1.2 percent growth this year, despite earlier forecasts of almost 2 percent. What\xe2\x80\x99s behind such a drop in productivity?</em> </p><p> <strong>Michael Mross:</strong> I can tell you it will become even worse. The numbers that we have now on the table showed that economy is not doing very well and it is getting even worse. [In] Europe and the eurozone at the beginning of the year the economy was already very fragile, and what made it even worse was of course sanctions that were imposed on Russia. In Germany alone we have a decrease in industry and export output by more than five percent. This is not only a downturn, this is a collapse, what we call it here in Germany, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a very big disappointment. The only way to get up is to solve the problems with Russia and get away from the sanctions. </p><p> <strong style="background-color: initial;">READ MORE:</strong><a href="http://rt.com/business/195896-german-economy-forecast-cut/" style="background-color: initial;">German economy in \xe2\x80\x98choppy waters\xe2\x80\x99, as growth forecast slashed to 1.2%</a> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>How dangerous is Germany\'s decline for the entire eurozone economy?</em> </p><p> <strong>MM:</strong> It will draw all the European countries even deeper. We have already had those very difficult and hard problems in the southern periphery \xe2\x80\x93 in Italy, Spain, Greece and now also France. If Germany is not well, then it will become even worse for all of these countries. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Germany\'s economy minister has blamed geopolitical tensions and global economic problems for the slowdown. How much of that is true?</em> </p><p> <strong>MM:</strong> The geopolitical situation is very important for Germany because we are an export nation number one. When you take the geopolitical crisis, not only the Ukraine issue, but also Ebola, ISIS, this is of course very bad for Germany and very bad for the eurozone. We have now all these discussions about austerity when it comes to France, for example. I have to say that France was always a country that lived from the depreciation of its own currency, of devaluing its own currency, but now it\xe2\x80\x99s not working anymore because we are together in one currency, in the euro. And now the question is what the remedy of the doctor is. Take two patients, the one has high blood pressure, the other has low blood pressure, and you have only one pill. Which pill will you give them? This is a dilemma that we have here in the eurozone, so many people now come to the conclusion Germany has to exit the eurozone in order to make it better for all the remaining other countries. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Austerity measures were set in most of the EU countries but they seem to be not working. Still austerity proved to be successful in the UK. Why?</em> </p><p> <strong>MM:</strong> If you have problems, if the economy is not doing well the first remedy is of course to make higher debt in the country. But they cannot do it because of all these restrictions that we have and because we are very cautious. We have a problematic situation within the eurozone that some countries, or one country, is doing very well and the others have many problems. So no doctor has a cure, no doctor has a medicine for this problem. My prognosis is that at the very end of the day all those remaining countries, including France which has no big problems, they will tell Germany to get out of the euro, they will throw them out of the euro in order to have some relief. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/news/196144-france-tweet-money-bank/</guid><title><![CDATA[Money tweets!

By 1988, these two countries alone had sold Iraq 85,000 empty M110-type shells, according to confidential United Nations documents.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> This is where the story begins to get very disturbing. </p><p> During the Iraq-Iran War (1980-1988), Baghdad actively sought the development of chemical weapons with the help of a number of Western countries, including the United States, West Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and France, according to internal <a href="http://fas.org/nuke/guide/iraq/cw/az120103.html" target="_blank">Iraqi documents</a>. <a href="http://fas.org/nuke/guide/iraq/cw/az120103.html"></a> </p><p> It is has already been widely documented that at least 50,000 Iranian civilians and soldiers were killed by Iraqi chemical weapons in the course of the war. </p><p> As the Times report detailed, many of the chemical weapons incidents were centered around the now largely destroyed Muthanna State Establishment, which was <em>\xe2\x80\x9cthe center of Iraqi chemical agent production in the 1980s.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> This is especially worrying because since June, that sensitive area has been in the possession of the Islamic State, which recently appeared on the scene in northern Iraq and Syria with public displays of extreme savagery that included the alleged beheading of American and British journalists and aid workers, not to mention Christian babies. </p><p> So the question as to how the United States kept the exposure of its troops to chemical weapons contamination in Iraq secret for so long has taken a back seat to the more immediate question as to whether or not the Islamic State has also gained possession of chemical weapons. </p><p> On Sunday, former Vice President Dick Cheney predicted that the next attack on the United States would be <em>\xe2\x80\x9cfar deadlier\xe2\x80\x9d</em> than the last one. </p><p> <em>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\'re in a very dangerous period,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Cheney, who regularly appears on the US talkshow circuit despite the dismal record of the Bush administration, told the Weekly Standard\'s Bill Kristol in <a href="http://rt.com/usa/195956-cheney-kristol-interview-terror-torture/" target="_blank">a video interview</a>. <em>\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\'s more threatening than the period before 9/11.</em> </p><p> <em>"I think 9/11 will turn out to be not nearly as bad as the next mass casualty attack against the United States, which, if and when it comes, will be with something far deadlier than airline tickets and box cutters."</em> </p><p> Does Mr. Cheney know something that the American public - much as it has been clueless about the chemical weapons in Iraq - does not yet know about? </p><p> That would be a far more disturbing revelation. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/196176-iran-dissidents-nuclear-weapons-terrorism/</guid><title><![CDATA[Who are the \xe2\x80\x9cIranian dissidents?\xe2\x80\x9d US media promotes bizarre terrorist cult]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/196176-iran-dissidents-nuclear-weapons-terrorism/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/e5/00/00/51.jpg" title="Masoud Rajavi.(AFP Photo / Adrian Dennis)"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 12:46:11 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/e5/00/00/51.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />The forgotten history of a group of \xe2\x80\x9cIranian dissidents\xe2\x80\x9d being promoted in Western media shows the hypocrisy of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cWar on Terror.\xe2\x80\x9d]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/e5/00/00/51.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Masoud Rajavi.(AFP Photo / Adrian Dennis)" /> <p> <span style="background-color: initial;">The Associated Press published an article entitled</span> <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/9f394215c52e4c9ab86bc4af5b2d36de/iran-dissidents-tehran-continues-nuke-arms-work" target="_blank"><em>\xe2\x80\x9cIran Dissident</em></a><span style="background-color: initial;"><em>: Tehran Continues Nuke Arms Work\xe2\x80\x9d</em> earlier in October.

On September 17th, when the French government dropped money-laundering charges against the organization, the headlines reporting the case continued to refer to its members as <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/17/us-france-iran-ncri-idUSKBN0HC1OR20140917" target="_blank">\xe2\x80\x9cIranian dissidents.\xe2\x80\x9d</a> The articles in Bloomberg News and The Wall Street Journal contained nothing about what this <em>\xe2\x80\x9cMujahadeen-e-Khalq\xe2\x80\x9d</em> organization is - or what kind of activities it has engaged in. </p><p> The most extreme example of hypocritical treatment for this organization comes from Murdoch-owned, ideologically neoconservative FOX News. FOX News hosts and commentators are known for stirring up rumors of US President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s alleged links to Marxism and Islamic radicalism. Recently, FOX News host Megyn Kelly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8as2Ay_qGDM" target="_blank">interviewed</a> Professor William Ayers, demanding to know why he wouldn\'t <em>\xe2\x80\x9ctake responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d</em> after she listed various terrorist acts she claimed he was involved in. Kelly also recently berated Ward Churchill, Native American Professor at the University of Colorado, claiming words he wrote in a 2001 essay emotionally harmed the families of 9/11 victims. </p><p> However, on June 16, FOX News anchor and senior correspondent Eric Shawn sat down across from an actual, self-proclaimed <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIslamic Marxist\xe2\x80\x9d</em> named Maryam Rajavi, who is linked to the death of thousands of innocent civilians in Iran, as well as many Americans, who were killed by the MEK in the last few decades. While facing this real life, violent terrorist extremist, the FOX anchor threw softballs. He allowed the spokesperson for MEK to spew her rhetoric against the Iranian government without interruption. In his questions, Shawn even compared Rajavi to the resistance forces that fought the Nazis. </p><p> If cable news viewers and consumers of US print media knew who these <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIranian dissidents\xe2\x80\x9d</em> actually were, they would begin to ask some serious questions about US foreign policy. </p><h2> What is the Mujahadeen-e-Khalq? </h2><p> The Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (People\xe2\x80\x99s Army of God) organization was founded in the 1960s as a student group opposed to the Shah. It eventually began work toward achieving its aims with isolated acts of violence such as assassinations, bombings, and kidnappings. Its beliefs included a bizarre mixture of Islam and Marxism. One of the group\xe2\x80\x99s primary beliefs is in the brilliance of its founder and leader, Massoud Rajavi, who is worshipped in a cultish manner. At recent rallies in France, for example, placards carried by MEK members contained the simple slogan <em>\xe2\x80\x9cMassoud Rajavi Is Our Leader.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Massoud Rajavi\xe2\x80\x99s location is unknown, and he has not made a public appearance since 2003. Rajavi\xe2\x80\x99s spouse, Maryam Rajavi, now acts as the primary public representative of the group. </p><p> In its early years, MEK primarily targeted people from the United States. The group attempted to kidnap the US ambassador to Iran. It carried out an attempted assassination of a US Air Force General. In 1976, the organization attacked a car and killed the three American hotel employees inside. These terrorist acts were done in the hope of damaging the US backed Iranian monarchy. </p><p> However, it was not the isolated acts of adventurist violence from MEK members, but a rather broad explosion of popular resistance that toppled the US-backed Shah in 1979. After Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Islamic Revolution in 1979, when it became clear that the MEK would not become the new ruling party, the organization responded with a vicious bombing campaign against the new government. In 1981, the group bombed a meeting of the Iranian Republican Party, killing 72 people, including many high-ranking government officials. </p><p> </p><p> During the Iraq-Iran War, the group became very friendly with Saddam Hussein. With money pouring in from the Iraqi regime, the group formed an armed outfit called the <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIranian National Liberation Army.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> They went through Iran committing war crimes, hoping that they could secure victory for the US-backed Iraqi invaders that used chemical and biological weapons against Iranian civilians. </p><p> In one particularly brutal war atrocity, the MEK group killed nearly all the residents of a village called Islamabad-e Gharb. The group staged this cowardly attack on July 26th, 1988 - six days after Imam Khomeini had announced he was accepting a ceasefire with Iraq. </p><p> The number of innocent civilians slaughtered by the MEK or its various front groups such as the Iranian National Council of Resistance, is likely to be in the tens of thousands, if you include the number of civilians killed during the bombing campaigns, the number of people MEK linked groups slaughtered during the Iraq-Iran War, and the number of victims of MEK terrorism against Iran throughout the 1990s and up to today. Human Rights Watch has issued condemnations of the group for routinely torturing those it holds captive. </p><p> The internal workings of the group are equally frightening. A Human Rights Watch <a href="http://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/mena/iran0505/1.htm" target="_blank">report from 2005</a> describes how, within its various bases and camps, the group subjects members to summary execution for violations of its bizarre regulations and practices. According to ex-members of MEK, it functions as a very dangerous cult. All members are required to divorce their spouses, as family life is considered a distraction from the cause of overthrowing the Iranian state. The words of Massoud and Maryam Rajavi are interpreted as divine and infallible, and members are encouraged to seek martyrdom to advance the ideological and religious goals. </p><h2> The coddling of dangerous extremists </h2><p> Frequently, Iran is declared to be a <em>\xe2\x80\x9cstate sponsor of terror\xe2\x80\x9d</em> by US officials and media outlets. However, it is leaders of the United States that are currently promoting the cause of the dangerous and violent MEK. </p><p> Hillary Clinton played an important role in removing the group from the official state department list of <em>\xe2\x80\x9cForeign Terrorist Organizations.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Rudy Giuliani, former Mayor of New York City, promotes its cause by acting as MEK\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman. Tom Ridge, former head of the Department of Homeland Security, has played a similar role for the group. Very few US media commentators have highlighted the irony of <em>\xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s Mayor\xe2\x80\x9d</em> embracing a group of <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIslamic Marxist\xe2\x80\x9d</em> militants - and the truth about MEK and its relationship with figures in Washington DC is largely unknown. </p><p> Occasionally, US officials will try to justify the coddling of this group of violent extremists with vague claims that it <em>\xe2\x80\x9crenounced violence.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> However, the group is very open about continuing its armed underground activities inside the Islamic Republic of Iran. Reports indicate that it was members of MEK, in cooperation with the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2012/04/11/Obama-Leak-Israel-Iran" target="_blank">Mossad</a> that assassinated scientists working on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s peaceful nuclear energy program in 2012. </p><p> While MEK denies it works with the Israeli government, a fact that should shatter the credibility of anyone claiming to be an <em>\xe2\x80\x9cIslamic Marxist,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> the truth was leaked to NBC by the Obama Administration. </p><p> The US press largely treats MEK like romantic pacifist freedom fighters. In her interviews, Maryam Rajavi seems frighteningly confident that she will be successful and her organization will someday come to power. </p><p> In her interview with FOX\xe2\x80\x99s Shawn, she said, <em>\xe2\x80\x9cI am confident the mullah\xe2\x80\x99s religious dictatorship will not last and will be overthrown.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> In the interview, a woman who oversaw the slaughter of thousands compared herself to Jefferson, Lincoln, and even pacifist civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. FOX\xe2\x80\x99s Shawn sat in front of her nodding, never questioning her words or intentions. </p><p> If one looks at Libya after the US/NATO <em>\xe2\x80\x9cregime change,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> or the state of Syria after four years of US-funded civil war against the government, it should be clear what \xe2\x80\x9cregime change\xe2\x80\x9d in Iran will mean. The fact that the US media is openly promoting extremists like MEK - and their fantastic claims about nuclear weapons - should be a warning call to all who would support US efforts in the region. </p><p> The promises from US officials of <em>\xe2\x80\x9cstability\xe2\x80\x9d</em> made before the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, or the overthrow of Gaddafi, never materialized. Instead, the various US- and NATO-installed collaborators and extremists turned their guns against each other. With chaos and destruction in the region, the US and Israel remained secure in their control of the oil profits and world markets. </p><p> The poster children for the US/Israeli crusade against the Islamic Republic, Massoud and Maryam Rajavi are hardly capable of bringing peace and stability. The MEK is much like ISIS in Syria, or the US-backed insurgents in Libya. They are bloodthirsty extremists who would destroy Iran\xe2\x80\x99s existing stability and independent economic development, replacing it with chaos, destruction, and death. </p><p> The promotion of such extremists, who unleash violence and chaos, fits perfectly with the realpolitik strategy laid out by former US National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski: <em>\xe2\x80\x9cMaintain security dependence among the vassals, to keep tributaries pliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from coming together.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> (Zbigniew Brzezinski <em>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Grand Chessboard,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> p. 40) </p><p> The program of the United States and Israel for the Middle East is permanent civil war, chaos, and death. Part of implementing this program is the rallying cry of <em>\xe2\x80\x9cregime change in Iran,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> and the promotion of violent terrorists who oppose the Islamic Republic. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/196164-ebola-outbreak-cure-who/</guid><title><![CDATA[\xe2\x80\x98Up to 50% of victims catch Ebola at funerals\xe2\x80\x99]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/196164-ebola-outbreak-cure-who/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/e4/40/00/46.jpg" title="Infection control nurse Marc Dangel (R) assists his colleague Heinz Schuhmacher to wear a protection suit during a media presentation at an isolation ward for possible Ebola patients at of the Universitaetsspital Basel hospital in Basel October 15, 2014.(Reuters / Arnd Wiegmann)"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 12:11:44 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/e4/40/00/46.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Containment of the Ebola outbreak requires isolation of infected people while they are receiving treatment, as well as safe and dignified burials, World Health Organization spokeswoman Winifred Romeril told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/e4/40/00/46.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Infection control nurse Marc Dangel (R) assists his colleague Heinz Schuhmacher to wear a protection suit during a media presentation at an isolation ward for possible Ebola patients at of the Universitaetsspital Basel hospital in Basel October 15, 2014.(Reuters / Arnd Wiegmann)" /> <p> <span style="background-color: initial;"><strong>RT:</strong> <em>We have comparative numbers for killer contagious viruses, for example flu\'s death toll is up to half a million a year and pneumonia kills about 4 million per year. From the start of the Ebola outbreak, it has killed at least 4000 people. So why is Ebola getting this level of concern when other infections are claiming far more lives?</em></span> </p><p> <strong>Winifred Romeril:</strong> Ebola is scary because it\xe2\x80\x99s so lethal. You don\xe2\x80\x99t infect many people, when one person gets ill, they maybe infect two people. But right now maybe half of those people or higher might die. I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s a reason for concern because it is so virulent. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>So meaning almost 100 percent lethality, can we say that Ebola is a real killer?</em> </p><p> <strong>WR:</strong> It is. Certainly you will find people in the countries that have been affected saying that it really gets to the heart of our culture. Like we see in some of these West African nations where people are very affectionate, they hug a lot, they care for the people around them, and you can get Ebola from people who are infected by being in contact with them... When people are sick, people take care about each other, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the time when people are most infectious, when they are already quite ill. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Ebola was discovered in the 1970s, and the world has already seen other Ebola outbreaks. Why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it stopped when the first cases of infected people were discovered?</em> </p><p> <strong>WR:</strong> It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t diagnosed as soon as other outbreaks mostly because it mimics a lot of other diseases. Ebola has never been seen in this area of Africa before - in West Africa they\xe2\x80\x99ve never dealt with Ebola. When it broke out it was actually in the middle of a time when other diseases were on an upswing \xe2\x80\x93 malaria, cholera and other diseases that look like this. So there were tests on someone for cholera, for example, or malaria, that test would come back positive and they thought <em>\xe2\x80\x9coh, this person is so sick because of this disease that we confirmed they have.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Why is this pandemic spreading more quickly than other diseases?</em> </p><p> <strong>WR:</strong> First of all, as I\xe2\x80\x99m explaining, it got a head start on us. Often, when Ebola shows we find it right away. It\xe2\x80\x99s in communities where we have seen it before, they suspect it immediately and are able to contain it very quickly like we have seen in the case of Senegal and in the case of Nigeria - they were able to contain the cases that they had very quickly. But this time it got a three months head-start on the international community before we realized it was Ebola. So you have, for example, the case of one traditional healer: when that healer died there was a massive funeral gathering, and we can trace back over 350 deaths to that simple funeral, one funeral where people were in contact with the body. So that\xe2\x80\x99s why it got ahead because there was so much change of transmission that escaped and then got to the big cities. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t dealt with that before. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Where could it go? What is next? We see many worrying headlines now, are they overblown?</em> </p><p> <strong>WR:</strong> It depends on which headlines you are looking at. I do think Ebola can be contained. We do know how to contain it. It requires isolation of people who are infected while they are receiving treatment; it requires safe and dignified burials so that more people aren\xe2\x80\x99t infected at these funerals because up to 50 percent of people who catch Ebola catch it at a funeral. We have seen this in the early months of this transmission. So a safe and dignified burial is a really important piece. Of course, isolating people so that more people don\xe2\x80\x99t get this from the people who are already sick, and it can be really contained. The key to that is stepping up the international effort, and we still need more help, we are not there yet. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What are the major pharmaceutical companies doing in terms of finding a cure for Ebola? There is a drug which was found, but is it effective? Do we have it enough to cure everyone?</em> </p><p> <strong>WR:</strong> I believe you are talking about ZMapp but it\xe2\x80\x99s a drug that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had human trials to determine whether or not it really can work and as you have already said, there is not enough of the drug to really have an impact and treat the people who are ill at this time. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/196148-saudiarabia-oil-russia-economic-confrontation/</guid><title><![CDATA[\xe2\x80\x8bThe Saudi oil war against Russia, Iran and the US]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/196148-saudiarabia-oil-russia-economic-confrontation/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/e3/40/00/36.jpg" title="A fisherman pulls in his net as an oil tanker is seen at the port in the northwestern city of Duba.(Reuters / Mohamed Al Hwaity)"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 11:52:20 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/e3/40/00/36.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />Saudi Arabia has unleashed an economic war against selected oil producers.

This is political manipulation, and Saudi Arabia is being manipulated, which could end badly.\xe2\x80\x9d</em></span> </p><p> A correction is in order; the Saudis are not being manipulated. What the House of Saud is launching is <em>\xe2\x80\x9cTomahawks of spin,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> insisting they\xe2\x80\x99re OK with oil at $90 a barrel; also at $80 for the next two years; and <a href="http://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/402343--saudi-arabia-to-pressure-russia-iran-with-price-of-oil" target="_blank">even</a> at $50 to $60 for Asian and North American clients. </p><p> The fact is Brent crude had already fallen to below $90 a barrel because China \xe2\x80\x93 and Asia as a whole \xe2\x80\x93 was already slowing down economically, although to a lesser degree compared to the West. Production, though, remained high \xe2\x80\x93 especially by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - even with very little Libyan and Syrian oil on the market and with Iran forced to cut exports by a million barrels a day because of the US economic war, a.k.a. sanctions. </p><p> The House of Saud is applying a highly predatory pricing strategy, which boils down to reducing market share of its competitors, in the middle- to long-term. At least in theory, this could make life miserable for a lot of players \xe2\x80\x93 from the US (energy development, fracking and deepwater drilling become unprofitable) to producers of heavy, sour crude such as Iran and Venezuela. Yet the key target, make no mistake, is Russia. </p><p> A strategy that simultaneously hurts Iran, Iraq, Venezuela, Ecuador and Russia cannot escape the temptation of being regarded as an <em>\xe2\x80\x9cEmpire of Chaos\xe2\x80\x9d</em> power play, as in Washington cutting a deal with Riyadh. A deal would imply bombing ISIS/ISIL/Daesh leader Caliph Ibrahim is just a prelude to bombing Bashar al-Assad\xe2\x80\x99s forces; in exchange, the Saudis squeeze oil prices to hurt the enemies of the <em>\xe2\x80\x9cEmpire of Chaos.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s way more complicated than that. </p><h2> Sticking it to Washington </h2><p> Russia\xe2\x80\x99s state budget for 2015 requires oil at least at $100 a barrel. Still, the Kremlin is borrowing no more than $7 billion in 2015 from the usual <em>\xe2\x80\x9cforeign investors\xe2\x80\x9d</em>, plus $27.2 billion internally. Hardly an economic earthquake. </p><p> Besides, the ruble has already fallen over 14 percent since July against the US dollar. By the way, the currencies of key BRICS members have also fallen; 7.8 percent for the Brazilian real, 1.6 percent for the Indian rupee. And Russia, unlike the Yeltsin era, is not broke; it holds at least $455 billion in foreign reserves. </p><p> The House of Saud\xe2\x80\x99s target of trying to bypass Russia as a top supplier of oil to the EU is nothing but a pipe dream; EU refineries would have to be reframed to process Saudi light crude, and that costs a fortune. </p><p> Geopolitically, it gets juicier when we see that central to the House of Saud strategy is to stick it to Washington for not fulfilling its <em>\xe2\x80\x9cAssad must go\xe2\x80\x9d</em> promise, as well as the neo-con obsession in bombing Iran. It gets worse (for the Saudis) because Washington \xe2\x80\x93 at least for now \xe2\x80\x93 seems more concentrated in toppling Caliph Ibrahim than Bashar al-Assad, and might be on the verge of signing a nuclear deal with Tehran as part of the P5+1 on November 24. </p><p> On the energy front, the ultimate House of Saud nightmare would be both Iran and Iraq soon being able to take over the Saudi status as key swing oil producers in the world. Thus the Saudi drive to deprive both of much-needed oil revenue. It might work \xe2\x80\x93 as in the sanctions biting Tehran even harder. Yet Tehran can always compensate by selling more gas to Asia. </p><p> So here\'s the bottom line. A beleaguered House of Saud believes it may force Moscow to abandon its support of Damascus, and Washington to scotch a deal with Tehran. All this by selling oil below the average spot price. That smacks of desperation. Additionally, it may be interpreted as the House of Saud dithering if not sabotaging the coalition of the cowards/clueless in its campaign against Caliph Ibrahim\xe2\x80\x99s goons. </p><p> Compounding the gloom, the EU might be allowed to muddle through this winter \xe2\x80\x93 even considering possible gas supply problems with Russia because of Ukraine. Still, low Saudi oil prices won\xe2\x80\x99t prevent a near certain fourth recession in six years just around the EU corner. </p><p> </p><h2> Go East, young Russian </h2><p> Russia, meanwhile, slowly but surely looks East. China\xe2\x80\x99s Vice Premier Wang Yang has neatly summarized it; <em>\xe2\x80\x9cChina is willing to export to Russia such competitive products as agricultural goods, oil and gas equipment, and is ready to import Russian engineering products.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> Couple that with increased food imports from Latin America, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like Moscow is on the ropes. </p><p> A hefty Chinese delegation led by Premier Li Keqiang has just signed a package of deals in Moscow ranging from energy to finance, and from satellite navigation to high-speed rail cooperation. For China, which overtook Germany as Russia\xe2\x80\x99s top trading partner in 2011, this is pure <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2014livisitgrl/2014-10/14/content_18732940.htm" target="_blank">win-win</a>. </p><p> The central banks of China and Russia have just <span style="background-color: initial;">signed a crucial, 3-year, 150 billion yuan bilateral local-currency swap deal. And the deal is expandable. The City of London basically</span> <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/4e3ec352-51f8-11e4-b55e-00144feab7de,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F4e3ec352-51f8-11e4-b55e-00144feab7de.html%3Fsiteedition%3Dintl&amp;siteedition=intl&amp;_i_referer=#axzz3G1bqLiW5" target="_blank" style="background-color: initial;">grumbles</a><span style="background-color: initial;">- but that\xe2\x80\x99s what they usually do.</span> </p><p> This new deal, crucially, bypasses the US dollar. No wonder it\xe2\x80\x99s now a key component of the no holds barred proxy economic war between the US and Asia. Moscow cannot but hail it as sidelining many of the side effects of the Saudi strategy. </p><p> The Russia-China strategic partnership has been on the up and up since the <em>\xe2\x80\x9cepochal\xe2\x80\x9d</em> (Putin\xe2\x80\x99s definition) $400 billion, 30-year <em>\xe2\x80\x9c</em><a href="http://rt.com/business/195412-russia-china-new-gas-route/" target="_blank">gas deal</a> <em>of the century\xe2\x80\x9d</em> clinched in May. And the economic reverberations won\'t stop. </p><p> There\xe2\x80\x99s bound to be an alignment of the <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views/2014/10/06/can-china-and-russia-squeeze-washington-out-eurasia" target="_blank">Chinese-driven</a> New Silk Roads with a revamped Trans-Siberian railway. At the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit last month in Dushanbe, President Putin praised the <em>\xe2\x80\x9cgreat potential\xe2\x80\x9d</em> of developing a <em>\xe2\x80\x9ccommon SCO transport system\xe2\x80\x9d linking \xe2\x80\x9cRussia\xe2\x80\x99s Trans-Siberian railway and the Baikal-Amur mainline\xe2\x80\x9d</em> with the Chinese Silk Roads, thus <em>\xe2\x80\x9cbenefiting all countries in Eurasia.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> Moscow is progressively lifting restrictions and is now offering Beijing a wealth of potential investments. Beijing is progressively accessing not only much-needed Russian raw materials but acquiring cutting-edge technology and advanced weapons. </p><p> Beijing will get S-400 missile systems and Su-35 fighter jets as soon as the first quarter of 2015. Further on down the road will come Russia\xe2\x80\x99s brand new submarine, the Amur 1650, as well as components for nuclear-powered satellites. </p><p> </p><h2> The road is paved with yuan </h2><p> Presidents Putin and Xi, who have met no less than nine times since Xi came to power last year, are scaring the hell out of the <em>\xe2\x80\x9cEmpire of Chaos.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> No wonder; their number one shared priority is to dent the hegemony of the US dollar \xe2\x80\x93 and especially the petrodollar - in the global financial system. </p><p> The yuan has been trading on the Moscow Exchange - the first bourse outside of China to offer regulated yuan trading. It\xe2\x80\x99s still at only $1.1 billion (in September). Russian importers pay for 8 percent of all Chinese goods with yuan instead of dollars, but that\xe2\x80\x99s rising fast. And it will rise exponentially when Moscow finally decides to accept yuan under Gazprom\xe2\x80\x99s $400 billion <em>\xe2\x80\x9cgas deal of the century.\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> This is the way the multipolar world goes. The House of Saud deploys the petrodollar weapon? The counterpunch is increased trade in a basket of currencies. Additionally, Moscow sends a message to the EU, which is losing a lot of Russia trade because of counter-productive sanctions, thus accelerating the EU\xe2\x80\x99s next recession.

This is the second report on the Utica Shale this year. The town is one of very few where the quakes took place on a fault.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/news/2f/de/00/00/.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="AFP Photo / Mladen Antonov" /> <p> The new study, published Tuesday in the journal Seismological Research Letters, focuses on the eastern town of Canton, Harrison County, and three particular wells. It has found that the three wells operated in September-October 2013 in the Utica Shale caused 10 quakes of magnitude 1.7-2.2, among others. </p><p> But the case of Harrison County is one of a very few where, according to seismologist and lead author Paul Friberg, the quakes happened on a fault line. </p><p> Other locations where this happened included the United Kingdom, British Columbia in Canada and Poland Township, Ohio, according to LiveScience. </p><p> An earlier March study led to scientists with Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Natural Resources to shut down seven other wells in the Poland Township after fracking there led to two small quakes. </p><p> The current spate of Harrison County quakes struck less than 1.4km (1 mile) below ground, with tremors starting to be felt 26 hours after fracking started on September 29, 2013. This was followed by a total of 190 earthquakes in the 39 hours just two days later. When the pressure stopped, so did the quakes, according to the study. </p><p> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/UAEfxDjDqc4" allowfullscreen="" height="315" width="560" frameborder="0"></iframe> </p><p> Ohio Department of Natural Resources spokeswoman Bethany McCorkle told the AP that over the past year new seismic monitoring equipment has been installed in eastern Ohio in order to monitor for stronger quakes. </p><p> There is also an opinion that some underground dangers cannot be spotted until hydraulic fracturing is carried out there. In this sense, the findings can be used to prevent further, worse quakes. </p><p> It has been known for a while that hydraulic fracturing \xe2\x80\x93 which implies pumping huge quantities of water, chemicals and sand into rock to shatter it and extract oil and gas \xe2\x80\x93 leads to earthquakes. But it was previously thought that the effect is negligible. Now a growing body of evidence seems to suggest otherwise. </p><p> Rowena Lohman, an assistant professor of geophysics at Cornell University, who was not involved in the study, told AP that the oil and gas community have <em>\xe2\x80\x9cknown for a really long time, going back to the \'70s, that when you do any subsurface manipulation you cause small earthquakes,\xe2\x80\x9d</em> but also that <em>\xe2\x80\x9cthe big question is: are we doing something now that increases the probability that it will induce larger quakes?\xe2\x80\x9d</em> </p><p> It was found in another, unrelated study that just four wastewater wells in Oklahoma \xe2\x80\x93 where water is stored after fracking completes \xe2\x80\x93 are to blame for a massive number of earthquakes this year all taking place within a 30km radius. <br><a href="http://rt.com/usa/170552-oklahoma-fracking-wastewater-earthquakes/%5D"> </a> </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/usa/170552-oklahoma-fracking-wastewater-earthquakes/" target="_blank">READ MORE:Just 4 fracking wastewater sites cause 20 percent of all central US earthquakes \xe2\x80\x93 study</a> </p><p> As with Ohio, incidences of earthquakes increasing as a result of fracking have been witnessed largely in Oklahoma.

That is more than a 27.5 percent drop since June, when turmoil in Iraq drove up prices to $116 per barrel. </p><p> The monthly IEA report predicts oil supply and suggests the massive increase in production will further drive down prices. The sputtering world economy\xe2\x80\x99s lack of demand is no match for the abundance of oil. Demand from the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest consumer of oil, China, has dropped to 290,000 barrels per day, a more than 60 percent fall. </p><p> Supply in September surged. Crude oil output from the 12 OPEC member countries hit a 13-month high, and adding to the production glut is Libya\xe2\x80\x99s reentry into the oil supply chain, and its ambitious goal to start producing 1 million barrels per day by the end of 2014. </p><p> OPEC members have signaled they will not intervene by cutting output to keep prices from falling further. </p><p> </p><p> The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or OPEC includes Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Venezuela, Algeria, Angola, Libya, Nigeria, Venezuela and Ecuador. </p><p> Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s production has not been severely affected by the <a href="http://rt.com/news/195168-isis-kobani-video-insider/">advance</a> of ISIS, which also adds to the plethora of supply. </p><p> The oil surplus will affect each OPEC member differently. Iran, which last week was calling for a cut in production, said it would be able to handle a price drop, in the short-term, the WSJ reported. </p><p> Saudi Arabia, the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest liquid petroleum producer, is voluntarily cutting its barrel price to customers, in order to stay ahead of the competition. The country has billions of dollars saved up to weather low prices, but still needs a price of $80-90 to balance its 2014 budget. </p><p> The watchdog believes rising oil prices will resume in 2015. </p><p> </p><p> The US shale boom, which began in 2008 and has increased US crude output by 60 percent, is another element in the oil pricing rout. The IEA said North American shale will only remain profitable above $80 a barrel. </p><p> Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy is sensitive to lower oil prices, as the natural resource accounts for 70 percent of its total exports and together with gas provides 50 percent of the money used to fund the state budget. </p><p> Urals crude, Russia\xe2\x80\x99s key export blend, usually trades slightly lower than Brent. Russia\xe2\x80\x99s budget depends on $100 per barrel, but the Russian Central Bank is running stress simulations for prices as low as $60 per barrel. Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Urals crude oil experienced a significant drop from its June price of above $110 per barrel to its current level of $86.27. </p><p> For every dollar oil prices fall, the Russian budget loses an equivalent of $2 billion, Maksim Oreshkin, the head of the Russian Finance Ministry\'s strategic planning department, told Bloomberg. </p><p> <a href="http://rt.com/business/190628-sanctions-gdp-russia-oil-price/">READ MORE: Sanctions &amp; weaker oil prices could cost Russia 4% of GDP \xe2\x80\x93 official</a> </p><p> Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy could contract 1.7 percent in 2015 if crude prices average $80 a barrel, Charlie Robertson, the chief economist at Renaissance Capital, told Bloomberg. </p> ]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid>http://rt.com/op-edge/196124-ebola-outbreak-epidemic-vaccine/</guid><title><![CDATA[\xe2\x80\x98Good public health system - solution for Ebola containment\xe2\x80\x99]]></title><link>http://rt.com/op-edge/196124-ebola-outbreak-epidemic-vaccine/</link><dc:creator>RT</dc:creator><enclosure url="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/e1/c0/00/30.jpg" title="A health worker fixes another health worker\'s protective suit in the Aberdeen district of Freetown, Sierra Leone, October 14, 2014.(Reuters / Josephus Olu-Mammah)"/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 11:12:11 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<img src="http://cdn.rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/e1/c0/00/30.ec.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px;" />It is extremely important to take preventive measures, ensure good hygiene is in place, and undertake important steps towards changing behavior, Sheldon Yett, UNICEF representative in Liberia, told RT.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rt.com/files/opinionpost/2f/e1/c0/00/30.jpg" align="center" style="margin-bottom:10px;" alt="A health worker fixes another health worker\'s protective suit in the Aberdeen district of Freetown, Sierra Leone, October 14, 2014.(Reuters / Josephus Olu-Mammah)" /> <p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Why is Ebola getting this level of concern when other infections like pneumonia or flu are claiming far more lives? Is the situation really so serious?</em> </p><p> <strong>Sheldon Yett:</strong> Absolutely, the situation remains very serious on the ground here. People continue to die every day and this is something that must be stopped. The outbreak continues to spread. So yes, it is serious. Of course the impact of the disease goes far beyond the number of people who are directly contracting the disease, but of course has a tremendous impact on the economy, has impact on communities. It has impact on the ability of people to find food, to sell food. It has an impact on the ability of kids to go to school. So the impact of this disease is huge, massive, and continuous. </p><blockquote class="col-med flright"> <p> Dr. Nuhu Maksha, INICEF Immunization Specialist: \xe2\x80\x9cUNICEF has been working together with government departments to ensure that children are separated from their mothers when they are sick and they are attended to in terms of adequate nutrition.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> </blockquote><p> <strong style="background-color: initial;">RT:</strong><em style="background-color: initial;">Why is Ebola more dangerous than other diseases like malaria or flu, for example?</em> </p><p> <strong>SY:</strong> I think one of the most important things to keep in mind is there are very easy treatments for flu and many of these other diseases. Today, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a vaccine that we know works for Ebola. It is extremely important that we take preventive measures and that we ensure good hygiene in place, and that we ensure that measures that are important for changing behavior are undertaken here.

Why it is so?</em> </p><p> <strong>SY:</strong> I think one of the reasons is that it is in urban areas. This is the first outbreak that has really affected large urban areas. That makes it far more difficult to contain. And that has led to the spread of disease beyond cities that initially have been infected and other cities. That makes it far more dangerous. </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Why do you think Europe and the US are so worried about Ebola considering they\xe2\x80\x99re far better-equipped medically than African nations?</em> </p><p> <strong>SY:</strong> It isn\xe2\x80\x99t just Europe and the US, Russia is also very, very worried about it, China is worried about it. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a corner of the globe that is not worried about Ebola. Nobody wants the disease to spread across their borders because they have seen the devastation and destruction that it leaves. That is why it is so important to focus world energy and to focus the resources here in the epicenter of this disease and addressing it here. </p><p> </p><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>What states are at risk now? Where can it go?</em> </p><p> <strong>SY:</strong> Obviously countries with strong public health systems and good health infrastructure are far less at risk than countries with poor infrastructure. Unfortunately, Liberia is one of the countries that has a very poor health infrastructure. The health system has not received resources that it requires, and until the health system gets additional resources, unfortunately, populations will be at risk. </p><blockquote class="col-med flright"> <p> \xe2\x80\x9cThe [Ebola outbreak] took the West African region by surprise because it was here in Africa, but in a different part of Africa, and it came to us, to West Africa, and it was a new virus for us,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Nuhu Maksha said. </p> </blockquote><p> <strong>RT:</strong> <em>Can Ebola be contained?</em> </p><p> <strong>SY:</strong> The world has a good chance to contain it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the world concentrates its efforts on addressing the outbreak here, in West Africa. The threat and danger to populations here is much greater than it is to populations in the US or Europe or elsewhere in the world because people here are much closer to the epicenter of the disease.
